<h3>Psalm 51</h3>
<p><em>The priest and the people should alternatingly chant Psalm 51</em></p>
<p>Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy steadfast love;<br>
    according to thy abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.<br>
    Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!<br>
    For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.<br>
    Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in thy sight,<br>
    so that thou art justified in thy sentence and blameless in thy judgment.<br>
    Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>
    Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.<br>
    Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
    Fill me with joy and gladness; let the bones which thou hast broken rejoice.<br>
    Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.<br>
    Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.<br>
    Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.<br>
    Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.<br>
    Then I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners will return to thee.<br>
    Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of thy deliverance.<br>
    O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.<br>
    For thou hast no delight in sacrifice; were I to give a burnt offering, thou wouldst not be pleased.<br>
    The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.<br>
    Do good to Zion in thy good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,<br>
    then wilt thou delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;<br>
    then bulls will be offered on thy altar.</p>
<p><em>As the priest enters the madbaha (Psalm 43:4)</em></p>
<p>P: I come to the altar of God, to the presence of God, who gladdens my youth.</p>
<p><em>As he stands before the altar and bows his head</em></p>
<p>P: O God, I have entered your house, and I bow before your throne, O heavenly Father. Forgive me of every sin that I have committed against you.</p>
<p><em>As he kneels before the horns of the altar (Psalm 118: 27, 28)</em></p>
<p>P: O Lord, bind our holy days with chains to the horns of your altar. You are our God, and we will exalt you. You are our God, and we will sing praise to you.</p>
<p><em>As the north candle is lit</em></p>
<p>In Your Light, we see the light, Jesus, full of light.<br>It’s Your Light that shines upon our world, light our minds.<br>May Your Light reveal the sin in our hearts.<br>As we humbly pray, in spirit and truth.</p>
<p><em>As the south candle is lit</em></p>
<p>Pure and holy One who dwells on high, in mansions of light.<br>Cleanse our hearts and souls; we lift them up, unto You.<br>Grant us purity of thought and mind,<br>That our prayers may rise up to You.</p>

Praise be to the One Father, the merciful one who answers unto the sinners who call upon his name, and to the One Son, the kind one who accepts the penitent who knock on his door, and to the One living and Holy Spirit, who gives forgiveness to the guilty who appeal to Him. Thou art worthy of praise and honor and glory both now and all the days of our lives.</p>
<p>C: Amen</p>
<h3>Sedra</h3>
<p>P: O God, who is peaceful, who is compassionate, who is meek, who loves mankind, who is pleased not in sacrifice but in mercy, who loves a contrite heart more than burnt offerings, and who accepts a humble spirit over the offering of sacrifices and the blood of bulls and fattened lambs. Accept now our spiritual sacrifice on your living altar. Make us worthy to offer ourselves by this living service to you as an acceptable sacrifice, a life pleasing to your name. May we offer unto you living spiritual sacrifices, on your High Altar with grieving hearts and humble spirits. Let us become unto you a pure and great flock, so that we may be made anew and be sent into the new world as new people, being gathered with the souls of the wise and learned, and holding the torches of the worthiness of faith.

<p>P: O Lord, I knock on the door of your treasure-house, and beg for blessing. O, I am a sinner who has lost his way! May you command me to live by your grace and leave these things of which I have repented.</p>
<p>O merciful one, we knock at your door -  where have you gone? O king, who is honored and praised by the sovereigns of the earth. Without your grace, who do we have to pray for us?</p> 
<p>Father Son and Holy Spirit! You are our fortress and protection from the evil one and his armies against us. Gather us under your wings of mercy on the day of our resurrection.</p>

<p>Accept prayer like the incense that Aaron sent up<br>Receive service like the cry of the Ninevites<br>As you spoke unto Jonah<br>answer unto your servants</p>
<p>Glory be to God Jesus for his grace and mercy.<br>For how many gifts are spread over the whole world?<br>When the Ninevites called on you,<br>You delivered them from wrath</p>
<p>O God enthroned in the heights by the praise of your servants<br>
    You came down and dwelt in the lap of blessed Mary<br>
    May your peace and comfort dwell<br>
    In all four corners of the world<br>
