        <p>
          This site contains most of the liturgies of the Mar Thoma Church. Parts of the liturgy and many of the hymns were previously only in Malayalam; Here they have been translated into English.
          Hymns that were previously only in prose have also been versified.
          Some of these services are quite old and therefore may no longer be valid in light of various liturgical reforms.
