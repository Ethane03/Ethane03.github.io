        <h1>Mar Thoma Liturgies</h1>
        <p>
          I put this site together to be a single source for all the English liturgical materials of the Mar Thoma church. Other sources are scattered, not fully translated to English, or translated in prose but not in verse. The liturgical hymns and chants are some of the gems of the church. It would be good to see them used more often in English language services. The English liturgies here are an amalgamation of various previous translations, or translation by myself from <em>Pallikramapusthakam</em>. I primarily used the excellent translation done by the Mar Thoma Church of Singapore. I have also used the 1956 English translation of the Qurbana service by George Kuttickal Chacko. Most of the versification is based on the English hymns of the Malankara Orthodox church.</p>
