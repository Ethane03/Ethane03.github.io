      <h3>Opening Prayer</h3>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>Make us worthy, Lord God,
        to delight in the memory of your beloved, and to celebrate with pure faith and good works this memorial of St. Thomas,
        who saw your side which had been crucified and pierced by proud men, and thereby became a store-keeper of heavenly gifts,
        who lit the lamp of true faith [which shines] at all times in the four corners of the world and enlightened creation, 
        and bore afflication and persecution for it, and left his native land and tribe to proclaim it in the world, came to India,
        and preaced about his saviour.
        O Lord, let your Holy Spirit overshadow us as He did St. Thomas, 
        and on the last day, may we worship the abundnce of your blessings, and adore and glorify the riches of your mercy.
