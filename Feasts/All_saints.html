        Our Lord Jesus the Messiah, who is merciful in nature, abundant in grace and truth, who brings back those gone astray, is full of blessings, and loves all of his saints, we appeal to you, to
        grant us peace and calm on this glorious day, as we remember she who of all the tribes of the earth is worthy of blessing, the holy virgin Mary, who gave birth to God, 
        and also the prophets, the Apostles, the preachers, the Evangelists, the martyrs, the confessors, all the holy fathers who participted in the three synods of Nicea, Constantinople, and Ephesus,
        and all the true believers who have fallen asleep in your refuge. We ask also that you send us blessings and compassion from you, and that you shower us with the forgiveness of sins and the remission of debts.
        You did rescue from the hand of the evil and contentious Accuser (Akel Qarusa) those worthy and glorious saints who won victory in the spiritual and life-giving war of this world,
        you made them wide-spreading trees in your garden, you made them peacemaker who sow tranquility throughout the world s your witnesses,
        you adorned them in the robes of righteousness, washed and made white in your blood, and you crowned them with the crowns that were lost by the harsh afflications of your crucifiction.
        The Seers proclaimed you by their revalations. The Prophets foretold you by the announcement to come. 
        The holy Apostles spread the good news about you in their preaching. The confessors confessed you by their long-suffering. 
        The martyrs honored you byt he blood shed from their necks. The Teachers worshipped you by their teaching.
        All the faithful who have fallen asleep hoping on you, glorified you by their faith. You have counted them all as valiant warriors who were able to defeat the Accuser in their battle with him,
        and as blessed ones whose names are written in heaven, so that the Cherubim and Seraphim cry out in amazement and are joyfully glad.
        May it, O Lord, that on the last day, when you bless all the resting faithful, who have died in the true faith, 
        we too be worthy of the forgiveness of sins, that we have communion in their ranks, and that we stand among them.
        Grant freely peace and tranquility to all the world. We ever lift up praise and thanksgiving to you, your Father, and Holy Spirit, hosho...
