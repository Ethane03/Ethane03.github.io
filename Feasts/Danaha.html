            O Lord God who is the Maker of everything and the Creator
            of all things visible and invisible, You ordained a dazzling
            dwelling place for the heavenly hosts. When You created this
            world by Your holy will, You first created light, so that
            everything may be filled with it. You established the sky,
            spread it like a canopy, and decorated it with beautiful stars.
            You placed a ceiling above the waters and set Your chariot
            among the clouds. You meticulously laid the foundations of
            the earth over the waters, and adorned the earth with various
            kinds of flowers. To sustain the life of Your creation, You
            made the earth bear bountiful fruit, nourished the fruit and
            vegetation with rain and dew, and enriched the earth’s atmosphere with the flowing waters of rivers and streams.
            You created humans in Your image and likeness, and gave
            them dominion over Your creation. Humanity fell short of this
            great gift because of their disobedience, but You chose to
            restore them to Your divine nature through Your appearance
            at Your second birth.<br><br>
            O Lord, who has brought us here today for this divine
            worship, remain in us and with us. Remove the darkness of
            ignorance from our souls, and fill us with the light that comes
            from above. Illuminate our thoughts with Your rays and make
            us children of light. Deliver us from every evil thought,
            cleanse the filth and dirt within us, and make us whiter
            than snow. Make us pure, and worthy of Your divine
            enlightenment, so that we will be able to stand courageously
            before Your judgment throne. Make us worthy to stand at
            Your glorious right hand, and be worthy of the grace and love
            that You have for humanity. Surround us with Your light and
            conform us to Your likeness. You are the source of all divine
            gifts, and You, along with Your Father and the living and Holy
            Spirit, are worthy of praise, honour and worship from all Your
            creation on earth and in heaven, now and forever more.

  At Cana in Galilee, to demonstrate that You are the Creator

  Your indescribable wisdom, You changed the very
  substance of water and transformed it into the best wine, and
