        O Lord Messiah, who gathered Stephen, the firstborn of the martyrs, cheif of the deacons, mighty champion, warrior, decorated with divine adornment, 
        the blessed rock, the first sacrifice of the new Gospel, fully set apart as an offering to the Lord, 
        from among the suffering of the glorious crucifixion, who kept the first blessed fruit of the tree of crucifixion safely in the hall of eternal life,
        who raised him from the world in the beginning as firstfruits unto the alter on high, who made him 
        a sure sacrifice of peace upon the altar of the stones cast by a cursed people,
        because your servant stephen pleased God your father, he becaume worthy of the odour of spices,
        like a sweet and ripe cluster of grapes in your vineyard. You gladdened men and angels by it's delightful taste.
        O Lord Messiah,
        when you crowned St. Stephen - he who is the priestly grapevine full of spiritual medicine on the everlasting, glorious, and eternal grapestem, 
        shooting bamboo of divine grace, majestic blossom shining with the worthyness of true faith,
        fragrant lily [Susanna] sprouting with glory in the garden of Golgotha,
        redolent rose of insatiable love standing unwilting in the inner Paradise,
        unfading bright flower of hope that we will not be put to shame,
        unwithering bright green shoot, everlasting bone which pour out immortal honey,
        the unconquerable city-gates,
        the rock of unshaking forgiveness [earth?],
        the mighty soldier who showed dispassion against those who killed God,
        the great warrior who courageously bore the cross,
        the revealer of the mystery of the crucifixion,
        the faithful steward of blessed apostleship,
        the wonderous man who was like unto a clean censer spreading the incense of your sufferings over the earth - 
        the heavens opened and in the hour of his death you made him like you,
        for he prayed for those who had come to kill him. 
        O Lord, make haste to save us from the famous and troublesome stoning of the Evil one [Akel Qarusa] and from every decietful punishment of demons,
        Guard us from the speeding arrows of wicked men and of the Evil one, the enemy,
        and strengthen us against famous and well-known enemies.
        Deliver us from every kind of poision of that famous dragon.
        May we be able to delight at all times in the sweetness of a fortified faith.
        We will bear praise and thanksgiving to you, your father, and holy spirit, hosho...
