      <h3>Opening Prayer</h3>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>
      O Lord, who delighted in the supplication of the Ninevites, recieved their repentance, and removed the condemndation that had been set over them,
      by Your indescribable love for manking, remove from us and oppose the flow of wrath which is rightly set over us due to our errors and wandering.
      Do not reward us according to our sins and iniquities. Have mercy and bless us and the whole church that was saved by your precious blood.
      May we praise and give thanksgiving to You, Your Father, and the Holy Spirit.

      To the One who has mercy on sinners, who by his mercy delights in the penitent, the Good Lord who makes paupers rich from his Holy storehouse,
      who recieved the Ninevites because of His love of mankind, who gathers the lost and enters them into His garden,
      and by His kindness adorns the broken-hearted, belongs praise and honor and worship at this time, on all festivals, seasons, and times, and all the days of our lives. Hasha...

      O Lord God, who constantly interacts with us by showers of His grace, the Giver of proper aids to hi creatures by the abundance of many helps,
      who raises the faithful in the priceless gifts of every good and divine dispensation,  
      and who guards His servants who knock at the door of repentence and seek mercies and graces,
      Make us true penitents and good and pleasing servants (soldiers?) as you made a good example of the Ninevites
      by the preaching of the Prophet Jonah, great among the Prophets. You stopped the terrible judgement set over the Ninevites,
      and you removed the sword of blazing wrath from over them. Now O Lord, we too appeal to You.
      Do not discipline us by your wrath nor destroy us by your hate, but aid us in our afflication
      according to your fatherly grace, like a merciful father who disciplines us. Gladden us in your divine communion.
      May you bind us with your pure love, and adorn us with Your mercy. May wordly passions abandon us.
      O Lord, give us grace to be people who appeal to you alone, and love you alone.
      Redeem us from the nets (കണി) of Satan. Fill us with salvation and joy. May we obtain perfect freedom
      from sins by fear of you, and may we be made worthy of the crowns for those who do good.
      Take away the abundance of our unlawfulness and forgive us all of our sins. Make haste to save us from the agonies of Hades, full of darkness and bitterness.
      Hide us from all afflication that has come over us and it to come. Give the whole earth freely peace and tranquility from You.
      We shall mear praise from our mouths like the Ninevites, to You, your Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hasha...

      Our Lord, make our incense be an acceptable sacrifice and a pure odor before Your majesty.
      Make our fast a reconciling sacrifice and select incense before the most holy place of your honor.
      May our prayer enter before you as did the Ninevites', and may it be recieved before Glory. Hasha...
