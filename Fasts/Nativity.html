      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>Praise and thanksgiving be to thee, O eternal Child, who is omnipotent and was born of a virgin in the fullness of time, who has no beginning as God, and yet has a beginning as a man.
      Thou art the lord of lights, who by thy power appeared like the sun from a virgin's womb, and by your glorious dawn elightened all of creation, 
      You, who chose to become a baby in the womb, are the one who forms babies in wombs. 
      You, who were born anew in the fullness of time as a Son of David, were before all creatures and worlds.
      You, who were seen an infant at the end of time, are the one who enlarges families and tribes. 
      You, who nursed at the breast of a daughter of man in order to live, are the one who sends rain and snow to the earth.
      You, who dwelt in a cave like a pauper, are the one who established the mountains by your power. 
      You, who were held lightly in a young woman's hands, hold the base of the sky in your power.
      You, who were humbly wrapped in rags, dwell in the abode of power. 
      You who were peacefully held in Mary's hands, are awe-inspiring to the Cherubim. 
      You, whom the Daughter of David sung of in Nazareth, cause the Seraphim to tremble by your holiness. 
      You, who crawled like an infant in bethlehem, are the one who sets creation in motion by a sign of your hand. 
      O Lord, we have learnt in awe the womder that you have performed for our salvation, and understood with wonder your actions on our behalf, therefore we say together in awe: 
      <br><br>
      Wonderous art thou, O God, who became man without any change to your Divine nature. 
      Wonderous art thou, who dwelt in a cave, while the heavens and earth were filled by you,
      Wonderous art thou, who was contained in Mary's lap, though your true nature is endless and uncontainable. 
      Wonderous art thou, who became man, while you are the God of glory, unspeakable and invisible because of your power. 
      Wonderous art thou, who brought the Magi to duly worship your honor. 
      Wonderous art thou, who by your birth made peace between those above and those below.
      Wonderous art thou, who united the heavenly and earthly beings on the day of your birth, and abolished the wall between them.
      Wonderous art thou, who nursed at a breast, though you attentively nourish every world.
      Wonderous art thou, whom angels and mortals glorified in amazement on the day of your birth.
      Wonderous art thou, who drew near those above and those below to sing of your greatness on the day of your birth.
      Wonderous art thou, who was carried by a virgin, though a chariot of fire carries You on high, and you hold creation in your hand.
      Wonderous art thou, whom the Magi and shepherds saw plainly as a child, and in whose presence the Seraphim are astounded.
      Wonderous art thou, who became a good hope in many ways to the children of Adam's family on the day of Your birth.
      Wonderous art thou, who grew up as a child, and is exalted on a brilliant throne.
      Wonderous art thou, whose light shines on all creation, and who chased out the darkness from all places on the day of your willing incarnation.
      Wonderous art thou, who united Your Father to creation because you put on flesh, and liberally sowed peace and tranquility for mortals.
      Wonderous art thou, who on the day of your birth called in holiness those far off, and joined them with those near.
      Wonderous art thou, of whom angels announced to the world on the day of your birth, playing pipes and saying "This very day in David's town the saviour is born – the Lord Messiah".
      Wonderous art thou, of whom the angels sang praise in wonder "Peace on earth and goodwill to mankind".
      Wonderous art thou, whose incarnation is indescribable. 
      <br><br>
      O Child of wonder, we beseech you and pray to you on this day of the feast of your glorious birth, when you came in purity from the Virgin Mary.
      Grant us true knowledge of your wonderous incarnation for our sake, and devotion and pure thanksgiving for our salvation. 
      Grant us the absolution and forgiveness of debts, and respite from all that grieves our bodies and spirits.
      O Lord, may you be the one who absolves sinners with cleanliness, who fully sanctifies the repentant, and who ever aides and helps the children of the Holy Church.
      Make us worthy to stand at your right side in joy at your second coming, and to rejoice in your kingdom. May we bear praise to you, your Father, and the Holy Spirit, at this times and for ever, hosho...

      <p class = "subtitle">Isaiah 9:1-8</p>
      <p>
        But there will be no gloom for her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zeb′ulun and the land of Naph′tali, but in the latter time he will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

<p class = "tab">The people who walked in darkness
    have seen a great light;<br>
those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,
    on them has light shined.<br>
Thou hast multiplied the nation,
    thou hast increased its joy;<br>
they rejoice before thee
    as with joy at the harvest,
    as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.<br>
For the yoke of his burden,
    and the staff for his shoulder,
    the rod of his oppressor,
    thou hast broken as on the day of Mid′ian.<br>
For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult
    and every garment rolled in blood
    will be burned as fuel for the fire.<br>
For to us a child is born,
    to us a son is given;<br>
and the government will be upon his shoulder,
    and his name will be called<br>
“Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
    Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.”<br>
Of the increase of his government and of peace
    there will be no end,<br>
upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom,
    to establish it, and to uphold it<br>
with justice and with righteousness
    from this time forth and for evermore.<br>
The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.<br>

The Lord has sent a word against Jacob,
    and it will light upon Israel;</p>

      <h3>Psalm 85</h3>
      <h3>Praise of the Angels</h3>
      <h3>Epistle</h3>
      <p class = "subtitle">Hebrews 1:1-12</p>
      <p>In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than theirs.

        For to what angel did God ever say,
        
        “Thou art my Son,
        today I have begotten thee”?
        
        Or again,
        
        “I will be to him a father,
        and he shall be to me a son”?
        
        And again, when he brings the first-born into the world, he says,
        
        “Let all God’s angels worship him.”
        
        Of the angels he says,
        
        “Who makes his angels winds,
        and his servants flames of fire.”
        
        But of the Son he says,
        
        “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,
        the righteous scepter is the scepter of thy kingdom.
        Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;
        therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee
        with the oil of gladness beyond thy comrades.”
        
        And,
        
        “Thou, Lord, didst found the earth in the beginning,
        and the heavens are the work of thy hands;
        they will perish, but thou remainest;
        they will all grow old like a garment,
        like a mantle thou wilt roll them up,
        and they will be changed.
        But thou art the same,
        and thy years will never end.”</p>

      <h3>Evangelion</h3>
      <p class = "subtitle">St. Luke 2: 1-20</p>
      <p>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. This was the first enrollment, when Quirin′i-us was governor of Syria. And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered. And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.
        <br>
        And in that region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them, “Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which will come to all the people; for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
        
        “Glory to God in the highest,
        and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!”
        
        When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” And they went with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they saw it they made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child; and all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">St. John 1: 1-17</p>
      <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
        <br>
        There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came for testimony, to bear witness to the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness to the light.
        <br>
        The true light that enlightens every man was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world knew him not. He came to his own home, and his own people received him not. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
        <br>
        And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father. (John bore witness to him, and cried, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.’”) And from his fulness have we all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</p>
