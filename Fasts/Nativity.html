      the Almighty, eternally God of all, who saved us in power by coming in humility,
      the Lord of peace who gave us hope and peace by his birth in the flesh,
      the Sun of righteousness who enlightened us from the darkness of ignorance by his divine light,
      the Star that rose from Jacob and by its heavenly rays of light showed us the way in the night of wandering on the path of the world,
      the Good Shepherd who set out from Ephrath, the city of David, and wonderously shepherded us,
      the Bread of Life who was placed in a manger in Bethlehem,

      the Authority and Ruler of all who showed us his commands by drawing the Magi to himself from their land by the star that they saw,
      the One who showed us his lordship and his death by the gifts they offered,
