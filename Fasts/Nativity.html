      the One who showed us his lordship and his death by the gifts they offered,

      <h3>Sedra</h3>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>Praise and thanksgiving be to thee, O eternal Child, who is omnipotent and was born of a virgin in the fullness of time, who has no beginning as God, and yet has a beginning as a man.
      Thou art the lord of lights, who by thy power appeared like the sun from a virgin's womb, and by your glorious dawn elightened all of creation, 
      You, who chose to become a baby in the womb, are the one who forms babies in wombs. 
      You, who were born anew in the fullness of time as a Son of David, were before all creatures and worlds.
      You, who were seen an infant at the end of time, are the one who enlarges families and tribes. 
      You, who nursed at the breast of a daughter of man in order to live, are the one who sends rain and snow to the earth.
      You, who dwelt in a cave like a pauper, are the one who established the mountains by your power. 
      You, who were held lightly in a young woman's hands, hold the base of the sky in your power.
      You, who were humbly wrapped in rags, dwell in the abode of power. 
      You who were peacefully held in Mary's hands, are awe-inspiring to the Cherubim. 
      You, whom the Daughter of David sung of in Nazareth, cause the Seraphim to tremble by your holiness. 
      You, who crawled like an infant in bethlehem, are the one who sets creation in motion by a sign of your hand. 
      O Lord, we have learnt in awe the womder that you have performed for our salvation, and understood with wonder your actions on our behalf, therefore we say together in awe: 
      <br><br>
      Wonderous art thou, O God, who became man without any change to your Divine nature. 
      Wonderous art thou, who dwelt in a cave, while the heavens and earth were filled by you,
      Wonderous art thou, who was contained in Mary's lap, though your true nature is endless and uncontainable. 
      Wonderous art thou, who became man, while you are the God of glory, unspeakable and invisible because of your power. 
      Wonderous art thou, who brought the Magi to duly worship your honor. 
      Wonderous art thou, who by your birth made peace between those above and those below.
      Wonderous art thou, who united the heavenly and earthly beings on the day of your birth, and abolished the wall between them.
      Wonderous art thou, who nursed at a breast, though you attentively nourish every world.
      Wonderous art thou, whom angels and mortals glorified in amazement on the day of your birth.
      Wonderous art thou, who drew near those above and those below to sing of your greatness on the day of your birth.
      Wonderous art thou, who was carried by a virgin, though a chariot of fire carries You on high, and you hold creation in your hand.
      Wonderous art thou, whom the Magi and shepherds saw plainly as a child, and in whose presence the Seraphim are astounded.
      Wonderous art thou, who became a good hope in many ways to the children of Adam's family on the day of Your birth.
      Wonderous art thou, who grew up as a child, and is exalted on a brilliant throne.
      Wonderous art thou, whose light shines on all creation, and who chased out the darkness from all places on the day of your willing incarnation.
      Wonderous art thou, who united Your Father to creation because you put on flesh, and liberally sowed peace and tranquility for mortals.
      Wonderous art thou, who on the day of your birth called in holiness those far off, and joined them with those near.
      Wonderous art thou, of whom angels announced to the world on the day of your birth, playing pipes and saying "This very day in David's town the saviour is born – the Lord Messiah".
      Wonderous art thou, of whom the angels sang praise in wonder "Peace on earth and goodwill to mankind".
      Wonderous art thou, whose incarnation is indescribable. 
      <br><br>
      O Child of wonder, we beseech you and pray to you on this day of the feast of your glorious birth, when you came in purity from the Virgin Mary.
      Grant us true knowledge of your wonderous incarnation for our sake, and devotion and pure thanksgiving for our salvation. 
      Grant us the absolution and forgiveness of debts, and respite from all that grieves our bodies and spirits.
      O Lord, may you be the one who absolves sinners with cleanliness, who fully sanctifies the repentant, and who ever aides and helps the children of the Holy Church.
      Make us worthy to stand at your right side in joy at your second coming, and to rejoice in your kingdom. May we bear praise to you, your Father, and the Holy Spirit, at this times and for ever, hosho...

        You rested in an manger of animals, for the salvation (help) of tribes, in Bethlehem Ephrathah. 
        O Lord, who by your spiritual and pure incense you delighted those both near and far, and in all corners of the world, 
        come and dwell now into the interior Bethlehem of our souls, and perfume your Holy Body with reasonable incense burning in the temples of our hearts.
        By the pure incense of your love, may you perfume our souls and all our thoughts, that we might give thanks to you with joy and gladness, observe this holiday with happiness,
