          O Messiah, our God, who is the invincible peace of all
          creation, and the true tranquility reaching to the ends of the earth, 
          You are Love! You are called love, and you rejoice in this name above all other names.
          Becuse of love, you are known as the friend of mankind, and You honour
          those who accept this love. Through Your cross, You
          removed the barriers of enmity, and with Your
          own blood, You reconciled those in heaven and those on
          earth. You have reconciled these two and abolished
          the hostility between them through indivisible union between Your essential divinity and Your temporal
          humanity. By love you called
          those near and far, bound them in the unity of Your divine
          love and in the inheritance of Your eternal
          kingdom, and You preached peace and unity to the world.
          
          Through the word of peace brought by Your archangel,
          You revealed Your conception to Your virgin mother.
          In peace, Your mother visited Elizabeth, the mother of John
          who preached about You, and the joy of hearing Your words
          of peace, made him leap and rejoice, as a servant before his
          master. At Your birth, the angels preached peace to the
          shepherds. You granted peace to the women who longed for
          Your glorious resurrection. In peace You entered the upper
          room where Your apostles had gathered, and confirmed
          Your resurrection to them. When You ascended to the One
          who sent You, You granted peace to Your apostles by
          proclaiming, “My peace I give to You” and commanded them,
          “Love one another as I have loved you”.
          O our Saviour, protect us with this love, and by it may you steady our minds.
          Bind us to each other in this love.
          Through Your love, eliminate the discord and
          disputes that separate us. Through Your love, make us
          worthy to observe Your commandments. Through Your love,
          eradicate sorrow and distress from our midst. Through Your
          love, make us children of love and peace.
          Through Your peace, unite Your shepherds with their flocks
          and gladden the priests in their sacraments.
          Through Your peace, make perfect Your holy Church and her
          children, and goven them by your peace. By your tranquility, adorn your church.
          By your peace, delight her children. By your peace,
          gather those who are far and protect those who are near.
          Make her servants resplendent, and 
          unite her leaders. Through Your peace, regulate her
          ranks and order her great feasts. By your peace,
          pacify the wrathful, and adorn the elderly.
          By your peace, fill the distressed with joy. Protect Your
          parish with Your peace, purify our thoughts.
          Protect us from merciless superiors with Your peace.
          Unite and adorn us with Your peace at all
          feasts, and accept our Lent and supplications. 
          By your peace, grant us grace and forgiveness.
          Break the chains of our bondage to the evil one with Your peace, and remove his
          yoke from us. 
          May Your peace always be with us, and may
          divine unity reign among us daily. Bind our hearts with Your
          love and enable our thoughts to be focused on Your
          heavenly peace. O Lord of peace, enable us to thank You, Your
          Father who grants peace and the Holy Spirit who perfects
          true peace, hosho...
