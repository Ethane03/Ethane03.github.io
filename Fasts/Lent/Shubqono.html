        Praise be to thee, O Father, the heavenly peace. Laud be to thee, O Son, the peace of earth. Honor be to thee, O Holy Spirit, fulfiller of the Divine Gifts.
        The Father is the One who gave His Son unto Death for our salvation. The Son is the One who descended by His love and died for our sake. 
        The Holy Spirit is the One who rejoices in our goodness and by whom our petitions are granted. God is One in Essence and Three in Person.
        O One Lord, help us to sincerely be at peace with one another. My you guard us all in divine unity with you and in the bonds of love.
        You are worthy of praise and honor and glory on the joyful day of your glorious resurrection, at this time, on all holy days, seasons, and times, 
        and all the days of our lives. Hosho...

        <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>
          O God our Messiah, who is the unwavering peace for all of
          creation, and the genuine peace that abides across all
          frontiers and nations, You are Love! You are called ‘Love’
          and You rejoice in this name above all other names. You are
          known for the love You have for humanity, and You honour
          those who accept Your love. Through Your cross, You
          removed the barriers that created animosity, and with Your
          own blood, You reconciled those in heaven with those on
          earth. You have reconciled these two groups and abolished
          the hostility between them through the essence of the
          indivisible union between Your divinity and Your transient
          humanity. You preached peace and unity to the world, called
          those near and far, united them in the bond of Your divine
          love, and offered them the inheritance of Your eternal
          kingdom.
          O our Saviour, protect us with this love and may it govern the
          impulses of our intellect. Bind us together in Your love.
          Through Your love, eliminate the discord and fractious
          disputes that separate us. Through Your love, make us
          worthy to observe Your commandments. Through Your love,
          eradicate sorrow and distress from our midst. Through Your
          love, make us children of love and peace.
          Through the message of peace brought by Your archangel,
          You revealed Your conception to Your virgin mother.
          In peace, Your mother visited Elizabeth, the mother of John
          who preached about You, and the joy of hearing Your words
          of peace, made him leap and rejoice, as a servant before his
          master. At Your birth, the angels preached peace to the
          shepherds. You granted peace to the women who longed for
          Your glorious resurrection. In peace You entered the upper
          room where Your apostles had gathered, and confirmed
          Your resurrection to them. When You ascended to the One
          who sent You, You granted peace to Your apostles by
          proclaiming, “My peace I give to You” and directed them to
          “Love one another as I have loved you”.
          Through Your peace, unite Your shepherds with their flocks
          and enable the priests to rejoice in their sacraments.
          Through Your peace, make Your holy Church and her
          children perfect, unite her leaders and bring back those who
          have strayed. Through Your peace, regulate her
          organisations and integrate her great festivals. Protect Your
          parish with Your peace, purify our thoughts and keep us on
          the right path. May Your peace always be with us, and may
          divine unity reign among us daily. Bind our hearts with Your
          love and enable our thoughts to be focused on Your
          heavenly peace. Unite and adorn us with Your peace at all
          feasts, and accept our Lent and supplications.
          With Your peace, pacify those who are angry, and adorn the
          aged. Protect us from merciless superiors with Your peace,
          and graciously grant us deliverance. Break the chains of our
          bondage to the evil one with Your peace, and remove his
          yoke from us. O Lord of peace, enable us to thank You, Your
          Father who grants peace and the Holy Spirit who perfects
          true peace, hosho...
