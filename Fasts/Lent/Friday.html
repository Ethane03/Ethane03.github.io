          Our great God and Saviour Jesus Messiah, for our sake You kept a fast according to the flesh; by your fast and your struggle you showed to us the enduring way of life; at the end of the fast, which was a battle with the Accuser, you subjugated our enemy; and you made us criminals innocent by your great victory. Therefore, may you now by your grace make us too worthy of your special gifts and your divine blessings at the end of this fast.
          <br><br>
          Our Lord, at the end of our struggle, make us worthy of the wages that you have promised to true fasters, the pleasure kept in Paradise for your saints, the bridal chamber of light prepared for those who strive, the high and honorable place of the perfect ones, the beauty, adornment, and light of the good-natured, the shelter prepared for the fasters tested and elected by your grace, the victory for the wonderously innocent and mighty ones, and joy, happiness, and gladness with the honorable ones.<br><br>
          Our Lord, at the end of our struggle, make us worthy of the great and blessed joys in the Eden of the beings of light, the inheritance of the righteous, the blessings of mercy, the everlasting crowns of the martyrs and confessors, the comfort and harbor of the afflicted and those persecuted on account of your love, the feast prepared for your friends, the food of nobles, the light kept for the virgins, the great comfort prepared for the workers, the spiritual feast in which the righteous, the virtuous, and the sorrowful rejoice, the help to which the fasters look, the communion of the saints, and the splendor and light of true fasters,
          <br><br>
          Our lord, at the end of our struggle, make us worthy of spritual joys along with the impoverished, the blessed table at which the hungry are seated to feast, the inner Zion which is the mother of the saints, the Church of the firstborn, in which serve priests and noble deacons, the place at your right hand with the elect lambs, the voice of the invitation to the kingdom of heaven, the elevation of the humble, the exaltation of the mature, the praise of the spiritual angels, the Hallelujahs of the Seraphim, the majesty of your lordship, the praise of your divinity, to set out to greet you with interior Hosannas along with innocent children, with clean thoughts, white minds, and pure tounges, to greet you rightly with the bright lamps of the wise virgins, to be glad with you at the mystical meal with the holy apostles, to suffer well with you and with your creation, to faithfully honor your entombment with Joseph, Nicodemus, and the thief at your right hand, to be buried with you for three days, to be justified and raised with you unharmed, to publicly proclaim the gospel of your resurrection with the angels, to rejoice well in your peace, to spiritualy obtain the divine breath that is from your holy mouth, to touch your life-giving and holy side, to joyfully see the nail-marks in your hands, to properly recieve your overshadowing on our heads, to spiritually rise up with you to the heights of heaven, to stand in glory with you at the right hand of your father, to have dwell in us the Spirit, the Comforter, who dwelt also in your holy Apostles, to find Him unquietly, to magnify you in a worthy manner, with the Holy Apostles, and to exalt your, your father, and your holy spirit, who are one in essence at all times, hosho...

          By your grace, O Lord, accept this pure incense that we offer to your lordship at the end of our fast.
          Recieve the spiritual fruits that we offer from our hearts with clean consciences and sound wisdom
          May they be in your presence as the offerings of the righteous and the saints from the beginning.
          May the plauge that is sin, the drought that destroys souls, and the affliction that persecutes hearts be 
          cast out from the whole of your Holy Church. May we become worthy of the joy prepared for those who do your will,
          and praise you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit. Hasha...

        <h3>Readings</h3>
        <p class = "subtitle">Jeremiah 7:1-17</p>
        <p>The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: “Stand in the gate of the Lord’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the Lord, all you men of Judah who enter these gates to worship the Lord. Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will let you dwell in this place. Do not trust in these deceptive words: ‘This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.’
          <br><br>
          “For if you truly amend your ways and your doings, if you truly execute justice one with another, if you do not oppress the alien, the fatherless or the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own hurt, then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your fathers for ever.
          <br><br>
          “Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail. Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Ba′al, and go after other gods that you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered!’—only to go on doing all these abominations? Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it, says the Lord. Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. And now, because you have done all these things, says the Lord, and when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer, therefore I will do to the house which is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of E′phraim.
          <br><br>
          “As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I do not hear you. Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</p>
        <p class = "subtitle">1 Peter 1: 13-22</p>
        <p>Therefore gird up your minds, be sober, set your hope fully upon the grace that is coming to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct; since it is written, “You shall be holy, for I am holy.” And if you invoke as Father him who judges each one impartially according to his deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile. You know that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was destined before the foundation of the world but was made manifest at the end of the times for your sake. Through him you have confidence in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
          <br><br>
          Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart.</p>
        <h3>Evangelion</h3>
        <p class = "subtitle"> St. Luke 4:1-13</p>
        <p>And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit for forty days in the wilderness, tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were ended, he was hungry. The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” And Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’” And the devil took him up, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. If you, then, will worship me, it shall all be yours.” And Jesus answered him, “It is written,

          ‘You shall worship the Lord your God,
          and him only shall you serve.’”
          
          And he took him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here; for it is written,
          
          ‘He will give his angels charge of you, to guard you,’
          
          and
          
          ‘On their hands they will bear you up,
          lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”
          
          And Jesus answered him, “It is said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”. And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.</p>
