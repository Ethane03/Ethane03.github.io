            <p> Have mercy on me, O God, in Your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sins.</p>
            <p> Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
            <p> For I acknowledge my fault, and my sin is before me always.</p>
            <p> Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that You may be justified in Your words, and vindicated in your judgement.</p>
            <p> For I was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>
            <p> But You take pleasure in truth and You have made known to me the secrets of your wisdom.</p>
            <p> Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
            <p> Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.</p>
            <p> Turn thy face from my sins, and put out all my misdeeds.</p>
            <p> Make me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
            <p> Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</p>
            <p> O give me the comfort of thy help again, and establish me with thy free Spirit.</p>
            <p> Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</p>
            <p> Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health; and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.</p>
            <p> Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, and my mouth shall show thy praise.</p>
            <p> For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.</p>
            <p> The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.</p>
            <p> O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p> Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations; then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar.</p>

                Living, and Life-giving art thou in your very nature, O Lord our Messiah, who
                by love bore crucifixion to save us from sin, and of Your own will lay in a tomb to bring us out of the prison of Sheol,
                and descended to the dead to lay your holy eyes on us and give us life,
                we worship and praise you for your every mercy on this day of Your resurrection.
                For You O Lord, did die for our sake, dwell in the belly of the earth for three days,
                slay cruel Death, and seize Sheol and free the oppressed.
                You rose to life uncorrupted in glory, and you raised us with you.
                Your resurrection removed the enmity that Satan had brought between our race and Your Father, and made peace.
                You united heavenly and earthly beings, and by the water and blood poured from your side you destroyed the poison of the great serpent.
                By that invigorating blood you promised unfading life and the uncorruptable kingdom to all of Adam's children.
                By Your resurrection you gave life to Adam, and you renewed Him, your image.
                By Your victory you gladdened those above, and delighted those below.
                On the day of your resurrection the spirits descended to honor You.
                The angels gathered at your tomb.
                Those above joined with those below.
                The heavenly beings were reconciled with the earthly.
                The spirits joined with the embodied and sung songs.
                Now do we cry aloud with the divine musician David, for 
                "Behold! This is the day that the Lord has made.
                Come rejoice and be glad in it".
                This is the great festival of joy.
                Today the angels proclaim joy to earthly beings,
                today is sorrow for the crucifiers,
                today is comfort for the disciples,
                today is grief for the Jews,
                today is joy and happiness for the Holy Church.
                Today we have drawn near to the hope of life.
                Today the one who numbers the host of the dead, wakes the dead with his own voice,
                and gladdens his creatures.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, O Lord, we pray to you on this day that You rose to life from the dead,
                that you recieve that prayers and petitions that we, who are inadequate and sinful, offer to You,
                and grant us absolution of guilt and remission of sins. By the abundance of your blessings,
                grant good-health to the sick, comfort for the sorrowful, nourishment and happiness for the hungry,
                salvation and joy for those near and far, peace and tranquility to the wrathful and argumentative,
                comfort for the persecuted, maturity to the youths, support to the elderly, meekness and submission to the married,
                mental fortitude to the virgins, generosity to the rich, care and aid to the orphans and widows,
                justice to kings, obedience to servants, wisdom to the bishops, nobility of character to the priests, 
                pure lives to the deacons, absolution and righteousness to sinners and debtors, and
                enduring harmony and constant peace for all the children of the church.
                Make us worthy, O Lord, to praise you with the angels who glorified and praised you at your tomb and with the disciples and holy women,
                and to joyfully greet you on the great day of your second appearance, wearing white robes of good works, with your saints and all the hosts.
                We shall bear praise and worhsip to You, the Father, and the Holy Spirit. Hosho...
