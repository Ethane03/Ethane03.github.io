          Our Lord, the Messiah, you were begotten without beginning from the bosom of the Father.
          And your were begotten, in a wonderous and indescribable birth, from the holy virgin Mary.
          You wandered the earth as your vocation, like a shepherd behind his flock. You lowered yourself
          in order to remove the disobediant curse of the contentious Belial, to grant us might and victory,
          to perfect us in spiritual battle, and to make us glorious spiritual beings.
          May we recieve this fast with joy, and complete it with gladness, and thrive in every thing which raises us up unto our inheritence.
          This is the time for the spirits to come to our aid. This is the time for us to wipe away mud and be pure.
          This is the time for one to cast away guilt, and not make increase of sin.
          This is the time for one to blot out the old bill, without adding guilt to their guilt.
          This is the time for one to wash away the stains on their soul, without renewing the record of their wrongs.
          This is the time for one to settle their debts, without increasing their impurity.
          This is the time for one to do good works, without adding to their debts.
          No one ought to be slothful. 
          This is the time for one to do useful work, without being counted among the slothful.
          This is the time which raises us up to heaven.
          This is the time for fasters to be like the angels, not loving wordly works.
          This is the time for one to walk in the path of purity, abstaining from gluttony.
          This is the time for one to love humility, not walking in the way of pride, nor feeling [synonym for pride???].
          This is the time for the insolent to be meek.
          This is the time to put on suffering and sorrow, while those with fine clothes ought not be puffed up, nor should anyone partake in joyful things.
          This is the time for each person to love glorious conduct, without causing their tounge to err with hateful things.
          This is the time of abstinence.
          This is the time to abound in goodness.
          This is the time to prepare our tongues with thanksgiving.
          This is the time for us to strive to do good.
          This is the time for us to loose the bonds of sin from us.
          This is the time to bring holiness to our thoughts and purity to our works.
          This is the time which shows us the way of life unto the heights above.
          This is the time to mend the wounds of the soul.
          This is the time to wipe away the filth of our bodies.
          This is the time which crowns us with unfading crowns.
          This is the time for our hearts to be filled with love, and for peace to abound among us.
          This is the time for us to be drawn up out of the sea of sin.
          This is the time of righteousness and virtue.
          
          We beseech you, O Lord, who appeared to us by your love of mankind, and we pray to you.
          Grant us strength to oppose and overcome all the schemes of the evil one.
          Make us worthy to remain in faith, unerring and unshaken, to keep the fast with purity and holiness,
          to complete it with joy and praise, and to greet you with joyous faces. To you, your father, and holy Spirit, we shall lift up praise and thanksgiving, hosho...
