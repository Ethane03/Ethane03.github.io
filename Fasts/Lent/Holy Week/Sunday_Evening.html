            <p class = "subtitle">Melody : Hakthilu</p>
            <p>Praise be to the Lord- who has fulfilled<br>
            all mysteries by - his sacrifice<br>
            The mysteries that - the prophets spoke<br>
            You have fulfilled in your own body
            </p>
            <p>
                When the heir came to - Jerusalem<br>
                to visit His own - they knew him not<br>
                Some sang Hosanna - and praised the Lord<br>
                Others were enraged - and rebuked them 
            </p>
            <p>
                They petition You - to halt the voice<br>
                of the children who - sing hosanna<br>
                You answered to them - with holy words<br>
                "If these stop then the - stones will cry out"
            </p>
            <p>
                Lord, who came in search - of your people<br>
                You were rejected - by your people<br>
                Son, who came for fruit - from His garden<br>
                The Jews despised and - crucified You. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Son burns with rage - in the temple<br>
                His fathers house is - a den of theives<br>
                The merchants knew not - the power that<br>
                rebuked and drove them - from the temple</p>
            <p>
                They have not the eyes - to see the glow<br>
                of the Father's seal - upon your face<br>
                Satan has darkened - their inner eye<br>
                Scripture's mystery - is unrevealed
            </p>
            <p>
                "They have eyes to see - yet they see not<br>
                They have ears to hear - but they hear not<br>
                They have not a mind - for discernment<br>
                A wicked people" - The Lord did say
            </p>
            <p>
                You declared to them - for them to hear<br>
                You shall take from them - the great vineyard<br>
                And you shall give it - to the nations<br>
                Who bear fruit proper - to that garden<br>
            </p>    
            <p>
                The curs'd assembly - is conspiring<br>
                to murder the Lord - on this feast day<br>
                Seeking the right time - they go search for<br>
                Judas Iscariot - and the others
            </p>
            <p>
                The words that foretold "Dogs surround you,<br>
                and wolves encircle - you to eat you"<br>
                The Lord knew this word - was then fulfilled<br>
                As he bore all this - in his patience
            </p>
            <p>
                Lord, who came to wash - the stain of sin<br>
                cast us not into - the <em>fire</em> of wrath<br>
                Sanctify us as - your own temple<br>
                And prepare us to - make offerings
            </p>

                O Lord who sits in the secret place of the Most High, shelter us beneath the shadow of the wings of Thy mercy, and have compassion upon us.
                Thou, who hearest all things, in Thy loving kindness, hearken to the supplications of Thy servants.
                Grant us, O Messiah; our Savior; a peaceful evening and a sinless night, for Thou art a glorious king, and unto Thee, are our eyes lifted up.
                Forgive our debts and our sins; have mercy upon us, both in this world and in that to come.
                May Thy loving kindness shelter us O Lord, and Thy grace be upon our faces. May Thy cross protect us from the evil one and his hosts.
                Let Thy right hand overshadow us all the days of our lives, and Thy peace reign among us, do Thou give hope and salvation to the souls that pray to Thee.
