            <p>Good One, who was rejected by his own people<br>
            were you despised because you descended to them?<br>
            You, the righteous One, recieved insult from sinners<br>
            And although you could destroy them, you forgave them<br>
            You did not hate them though they heaped curses on you<br>
            You adorned yourself with love and humulity<br>

                With those same tounges they now spit in your holy face<br>
                You cast out demons but were called "Chief of demons"<br>
                You cured their sick yet they call out in mockery<br>
                What a wonder of love is reflected in You<br>
                When you remember us, you heart burns within you
                Grant us your spirit, to search and to know your love<br>
                For by whom, O my Lord, can it be put to words?
