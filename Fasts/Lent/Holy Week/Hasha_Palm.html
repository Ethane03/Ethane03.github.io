                First Lesson: Zechariah 9:9-17
            </h3>
            <p>
                Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion! 
                Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem! 
                Lo, your king comes to you; 
                triumphant and victorious is he, 
                humble and riding on a donkey, 
                on a colt, the foal of a donkey. 
                He will cut off the chariot from Ephraim 
                and the warhorse from Jerusalem; 
                and the battle-bow shall be cut off, 
                and he shall command peace to the nations; 
                his dominion shall be from sea to sea, 
                and from the River to the ends of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, 
                I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. 
                Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; 
                today I declare that I will restore to you double. 
                For I have bent Judah as my bow; 
                I have made Ephraim its arrow. 
                I will arouse your sons, O Zion, 
                against your sons, O Greece, 
                and wield you like a warrior’s sword.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the Lord will appear over them, 
                and his arrow go forth like lightning; 
                the Lord God will sound the trumpet 
                and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south. 
                The Lord of hosts will protect them, 
                and they shall devour and tread down the slingers; 
                they shall drink their blood like wine, 
                and be full like a bowl, 
                drenched like the corners of the altar.
            </p>
            <p>
                On that day the Lord their God will save them, 
                for they are the flock of his people; 
                for like the jewels of a crown 
                they shall shine on his land. 
                For what goodness and beauty are his! 
                Grain shall make the young men flourish, 
                and new wine the young women.

            <h3>
                Second Lesson (Romans 11:16-36)
            </h3>
            <p>
                If the part of the dough offered as first fruits is holy, then the whole
                batch is holy; and if the root is holy, then the branches also are holy.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot,
                were grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree, do not
                vaunt yourselves over the branches. If you do vaunt yourselves, remember
                that it is not you that support the root, but the root that supports you.
                You will say, ‘Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.’ That
                is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand only
                through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. For if God did not
                spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you. Note then the
                kindness and the severity of God: severity towards those who have fallen,
                but God’s kindness towards you, provided you continue in his kindness;
                otherwise you also will be cut off. And even those of Israel, if they do not
                persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them
                in again. For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree
                and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more
                will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree.
            </p>
            <p>
                So that you may not claim to be wiser than you are, brothers and sisters, I
                want you to understand this mystery: a hardening has come upon part of
                Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel
                will be saved; as it is written,
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘Out of Zion will come the Deliverer; 
                he will banish ungodliness from Jacob.’ 
                ‘And this is my covenant with them, 
                when I take away their sins.’
            </p>
            <p>
                As regards the gospel they are enemies of God for your sake; but as regards
                election they are beloved, for the sake of their ancestors; for the gifts
                and the calling of God are irrevocable. Just as you were once disobedient to
                God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience, so they have
                now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may
                now receive mercy. For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may
                be merciful to all.

                are his judgements and how inscrutable his ways!
            </p>
            <p>

                Or who has been his counsellor?’ 
                ‘Or who has given a gift to him, 
                to receive a gift in return?’
            </p>
            <p>

                Almighty and most merciful Lord the Messiah, who loves
                humanity, and who came down to Your own creation, in order to transform them
                to honour and worship You before Your redeeming agony, and who asked for the
                foal of a donkey to ride on, Your triumphant entry into Jerusalem was
                foretold by the holy prophets through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
                Regarding You, the patriarch Jacob had prophesied, that, “the sceptre would
                not be removed from Judah? till the arrival of the heir to the Kingdom”.
                Regarding this festival of Hosanna, the divine psalmist David, had foretold
                in song, that, “out of the mouth of infants, You had ordained praises.”
                Regarding You, the great prophet, Isaiah, had prophesied, “Jerusalem,
                Jerusalem! Wake up, wake up! Put on strength, O arm of the Lord.” Regarding
                this festival, the prophet Zechariah, had preached to the daughters of Zion:
                “Behold, Your King comes to you, triumphant and victorious but in humility,
                riding on a colt, the foal of a donkey”.  The truth of their metaphors and
                the promise of their words were completely fulfilled in You O Lord. In the
                abundance of Your mercy, You humbled Yourself for us and became a human like
                us, except that You were sinless. Through Your humility, You awakened fallen
                humanity. By Your incarnation, You removed the darkness of ignorance. You
                joyfully welcomed the innocent praises of children. O Lord of all blessings,
                on this festival, we pray for Your grace. We surrender ourselves and all we
                have for Your glorious ministry. Grant us grace to always live, by
                completely acknowledging Your mastery over our lives. Transform us to be
                bearers of Christ and useful instruments in Your service. Change our hearts,
                and grant us grace to sing praises to You, like the children of Jerusalem. O
                King of glory, Lord the Messiah, in Your mercy, visit Your holy Church. Fill
                her with good gifts. Save her from trouble. Preserve harmony and peace
                within her. May she be firmly founded on Your promises. Adorn her children
                with holiness. In Your abundant mercy, protect her. Bless all the
                evangelistic efforts being carried out both at home and abroad. May the
                light of Your holy Gospel enlighten the hearts of all nations. At Your
                glorious second coming, make us worthy to celebrate the festival of joy, by
                glorifying and singing praises to You, the Father and the Holy Spirit,
                together with the whole company of saints, now and forever more.

                When they were approaching Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the
                Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples and said to them, ‘Go into the
                village ahead of you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find tied
                there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it. If anyone
                says to you, “Why are you doing this?” just say this, “The Lord needs it and
                will send it back here immediately.”’ They went away and found a colt tied
                near a door, outside in the street. As they were untying it, some of the
                bystanders said to them, ‘What are you doing, untying the colt?’ They told
                them what Jesus had said; and they allowed them to take it. Then they
                brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it; and he sat on it.
                Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy
                branches that they had cut in the fields. Then those who went ahead and
                those who followed were shouting,
            </p></div></div>
            <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>
                ‘Hosanna!

                Blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David! 
                Hosanna in the highest heaven!’

                Then he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple; and when he had looked
                around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with
                the twelve.
            </p></div></div>
            <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>
                On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. Seeing in
                the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see whether perhaps he would
                find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it
                was not the season for figs. He said to it, ‘May no one ever eat fruit from
                you again.’ And his disciples heard it.

            <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>
                Then they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive
                out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple, and he
                overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold
                doves; and he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple.
                He was teaching and saying, ‘Is it not written,

                And when the chief priests and the scribes heard it, they kept looking for a
