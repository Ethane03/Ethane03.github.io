            <p>
                Behold, the wedding hall is prepared for those holding lamps alight.
                When the bridegroom comes they will enter the wedding hall with him.
                The ship has come to the harbour. The day of resurrection is at hand.
                Christ the King rises. Behold, how glorious and majestic is the wedding hall!
                All you who are invited by the bridegroom, arise and prepare your garments for the feast,
                and you shall be glad with him. May our lamps not go out as did those of the foolish virgins.
                For if they do, when the bridegroom comes and enters inside, we will stand outside.
                May our lamps be lit by you, O Lord. May our souls be adorned you. In your mercy, may we be companions
                and rejoice with you in the wedding hall. May our sin be absolved by you, O Lord,
                may our conscience by purified by you, may our souls be sanctified by you,
                and may we rejoice with the wise virgins.

                To the harbour of peace which gives comfort to the souls of all those who are grieved and suffering in sin,
                to the peaceful comfort which frees those who bore the heaven burdens of the law,
                to the one who invited wise virgins to his feast, and commanded us to light lamps wet with oil,
                and thereby wait for him, and keep vigil in his presence with light, purity, and joy,
                to him belongs...

                Jesus the Messiah, our God and Saviour is the harbour of peace, the abode of comfort, and the comfort of peace and tranquility.
                And good and eternal mercy has poured out upon creation. The good shepherd set out in search of his missing sheep,
                and found a royal creation hiding in sinful desires. He refined it in the furnace of baptism, purified it, and gave to it its first beauty.
                Lord God, may you fully free our souls from the bonds of sin. Make us worthy to be pure abodes of your divinity,
                without falling away from the grace of the Holy Spirit. Grant us grce to set out to greet you at your wonderous second coming, 
                with bright lamps full of the oil of righteousness, with the wise virgins. May we not hear that voice saying, 'Depart from me, I know you not'.
                May we not be aliens, O Lord, from the worthy and holy day of your wedding hall. Make us worthy of your divine vision, with flaming lamps and sounding horns.
                There at your love feast, may we delight in the choice foods on the tables of your guests.
                May we come with true faith to your spiritual harbour, the refuge of all the saints, and enter into it.
                Raise the horn of your holy church throughout the world by praises unto you.
                Enrich her with the songs of the Holy Spirit. At your second coming, may she and her children set out to greet you, holding spiritual lamps in her hand, andd wearing festal robes.
                Guard her from the many doctrines of this world, and strengthen her foundation of the rock of orthodoxy.
                Make peace and tranquility from you dwell in her. May she celebrate festivals of joy for you until the end of the world.
                Bless her head. Strengthen the ropes of her tent, and drive in its stakes.
                Set up the pillar of the cross of light within her, that she might not be shaken by the waves of philosophies.
                Ordain worthy shepherds to shepherd her with sobriety and zeal, and bring her to the harbour of peace.
                Sanctify her priests to serve in your holy presence with bright faces.
                Brighten her deacons, to stand in holy assemblies and sing hallelujahs, holding fast to angelic works with purity and holiness.
                Guide her children. Support her elderly. Help her young ones. Grant them strength from you, that they not be enslaved to wickedness.
                Raise the children in devotion to you. Seal the whole world with your victorious cross.
                Free those who are ill. Comfort the afflicted. Arise and give aid to the poor, the orphans, and the widows.
                Free those who are bound. Gather those who are scattered. May people of all ages draw near to the harbour safe from the wind and waves of the sea.
                May you prepare us with purity for the joy and gladness of your resurrection, which is the harbour of joy and peace,
                and the end of spiritual battle. May we delight in your resurrection with your holy disciples. 
                Draw us near with them, to that harbour of life, which gives blessed comfort to those who have laboured in your spiritual vineyard.
                We have been lightened by bright lamps, and therefore may we sing praise to the grace of you, your father, and your holy spirit, now and at all times and forever, hosho...
