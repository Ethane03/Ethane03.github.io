                  Judas kept watch for the hour<br>
                  to give Him up to wicked ones<br>
                  <span class = "tab"></span>The Son of life who - saved us by his wounds<br>
                  Was sold for the price of thirty<br>
                  pieces of silver on that night
                </p>
                <p class = "right">✠ O Lord, our God...</p>
                <p>
                    I offer my body for you<br>
                    as sacrifice upon the cross<br>
                    <span class = "tab"></span>My blood is shed as - forgiveness of sins<br>
                    For you here, and for all people<br>
                    Eat [them], drink [them] until I come

                    Ocean of Love! Deliverer!<br>
                    Who has cast out the Destroyer<br>
                    <span class = "tab"></span>I am your servant - O my Passover<br>
                    Give me the grace to serve you well<br>
                    now and all the days of my life

            <h2>Ba'usa of Mar Aprem</h2>
            <p>Lord who suffering agonies<br>
                have mercy upon us all<br>
                that we might partake in them<br>
                And inherit Your kingdom</p>

            <p>Manna rains down in the camp<br>
            The Warriors of Israel<br>
            Cry "Manna Manna" aloud<br>
            in joy for this nourishment<br>
            The bread tastes like honeycomb<br>
            As they place it in their mouths<br>
            They recieve a renewed strength<br>
            To continue their journey<br>
            Then withour grumbling they walk<br>
            Through the dry and barren land<br>
            The rock split and water poured<Br>
            like a river behind them<br>
            They drank from it and recieved<br>
            freedom from their enslavement
            </p>
            <p class = "right">✠ O Lord, our God...</p>
            <p>
                Lord who redeemed those oppressed<br>
                Beneath the yoke of Satan<br>
                O Manna, the bread of life<br>
                who was sent down from heaven<br>
                What a mystery we see<br>
                within you at your table<br>
                Your servants taste and know you<br>
                O Good One, Immanuel!<br>
                We recieve new strength from you,<br>
                and all grumbling fades away
                
            </p>
            <p class = "right">✠ O Lord, our God...</p>
            <p>
                Servants bathe and are made clean<br>
                In the river of your grace<br>
                They drink it and are nourished<br>
                and recieve blessed freedom<br>
                Give the joy of salvation<br>
                to us and lead us daily<br>
                Praise be to you forever<br>
                and your father and spirit
