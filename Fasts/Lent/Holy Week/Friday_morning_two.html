            <p>Blessed is the Lord who did - destroy the barren garden<br>
            which bore rottten fruit for Him - and planted instead the Church</p>
            <p>O King Omnipotent grant - your servants power and aid<br>
            that we might offer the fruits - of praise to you forever</p>
            <p>Praise be forever to You - who came to be sacrificed<br>
            Who redeemed the race of men - and accepts our offerings</p>
            <p>You abolished sacrifice - and fulfilled all mysteries<br>
            by being the sacrifice - that gives sanctification</p>

            <p>O Lord our Messiah, who was mocked by Thy servant on the day of Thy trial,
                on the day when Thou judges the world in righteousness,
                be compassionate and have mercy on us.</p>
            <p>Praise be to thee, O Lord...</p>
            <p>Our Father, who art in Heaven...</p>

                He saw the desolate world from Heaven<br>
                And he left the glory of the Father<br>

                Mortals had fallen into Divine wrath<br>
                Sinners were vessels for damnation<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>He became an offering<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>to save them by blood-shedding<br>

                Come before me, O Jesus, with Your cross<br>
                That I might look upon the true form of love<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>All I have is You alone<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>Without You, who shall I love?<br>
                I shall love you O Lord, all the days of my life

            <p>
                By the cross you bought salvation for me<br>
                By your blood you won a fortune for me<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>Now, O Death, where is your sting?<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>Hell, where is your victory?<br>
                At the cross the Lord shed a river of blessing
            </p>
            <p>
                From now on I shall sing songs of gladness<br>
                To the Lord on Earth, and then in Heaven<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>I shall enter the kingdom<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>in glory and blessed joy<br>
                Then shall you place a crown of gold upon my head
