            <h2>Psalm 51</h2>
                <p>
                Have mercy upon me, O God, in Your loving kindness; /
                in the abundance of Your mercy blot out my sin.</p>
                <p>Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin./
                For I acknowledge my fault and my sins are before me always.</p>
                <p>Against You only have I sinned and done evil in Your sight, / that
                You may be justified in Your words and vindicated in Your
                judgment. / For I was born in guilt and in sin did my mother
                conceive me.</p>
                <p>But You take pleasure in truth and You have made known to me the
                secrets of Your wisdom. / Sprinkle me with Your hyssop and I shall
                be clean; / wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
                <p>Give me the comfort of Your joy and gladness, and the bones
                which have been humbled shall rejoice. / Turn away Your face
                from my sins and blot out all my faults.</p>
                <p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, / and renew Your steadfast spirit
                within me. / Do not cast me from Your presence / and take not Your
                Holy Spirit from me.</p>
                <p>But restore to me Your joy and Your salvation / and let Your
                glorious spirit sustain me; / that I may teach the wicked Your way /
                and sinners may return to You.</p>
                <p>Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation / and my
                tongue shall praise Your justice. / O Lord, open my lips and my
                mouth shall sing Your praise.</p>
                <p>For You do not take pleasure in sacrifices; / by burnt offerings You
                are not appeased. / The sacrifice of God is a humble spirit, / a heart
                that is contrite God will not despise.</p>
                <p>Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion and build up the walls of
                Jerusalem. / Then shall You be satisfied with sacrifices of truth and
                with whole burnt-offerings; / then shall they offer bullocks upon
                Your altar.

            <p class = "subtitle">(Verses not bolded are not included in Malayalam version)</p>
            <p>[Psalm 141] <b>Lord, I have called upon You, / answer me;
                hear and receive my words.</b></p>

                <p>Let my prayer be like incense in Your sight, / the offering of my
                hands like the evening offering. / Set a guard, Lord, before my
                mouth, /a guard before my lips, / that my heart may not turn to evil
                words /and I may not do deeds of wickedness.</p>
                <p><b>Let me not take salt with impious men; / let the just man teach me
                and reprove me; / let not the oil of the impious anoint my head, /
                because my prayer was against their evil-doing./ Their judges have
                been restrained by the side of the rock, / and they have heard how
                gentle are my words.</b></p>
                <p>As when a plough cleaves the earth, their bones have been scattered at
                the mouth of Sheol. / I have lifted up my eyes to You, Lord, / and in
                You have I put my trust; /do not cast away my soul.</p>
                <p><b>Keep me from the hand of the proud, who have laid snares for me; /
                let the wicked fall into their nets, while I pass on.</b></p>  
                <p>[Psalm 142] With my voice I cried to the Lord; / with my voice I
                besought the Lord and poured out my prayer before him; / I showed
                him my affliction when my spirit was troubled, / but You know my
                path.</p>
                <p><b>In the way of my walking they have laid a snare for me; / I look to
                the right and see none that knows me; / the way of escape has gone
                from me, and there is none who cares for my soul. / I cried to You,
                Lord, and said, / “You are my hope and my portion in the land of
                the living.”</b></p>
                <p>Hear my petition because I am brought very low; / deliver me from
                my persecutors because they are too strong for me. / Lead me forth
                from prison that I may give thanks to Your name; / Your just ones
                shall have hope when You shall reward me.</p>
                <p>[Psalm 119, 105-112] <b>Your word is a lamp to my feet and light to my
                    path; / I have sworn and am resolved to keep the judgments of Your
                    justice. / I am greatly brought low, Lord, / give me life according to
                    Your word; / be pleased with the words of my mouth, Lord, / and
                    teach me Your judgments.</b></p>
                    <p>My soul is ever in my hands, and I have not forgotten Your law; /
                    sinners have laid snares for me and I have not strayed from Your
                    commands. / I shall inherit Your testimony forever because it is dear
                    to my heart; / I have turned my heart to do Your commands forever
                    in truth.</p>
                    <p>[Psalm 117] <b>Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise Him, all you

            <h2>Compline Psalms</h2>
            <p>[Psalm 91] He who sits under the protection of the Most High,<br>
                And glories in the shelter of God will say to the Lord:</p>
               <p>“My trust is in You,  <br>
                God is my refuge in whom I trust.”</p>
                <p>For the Lord shall deliver you,  <br>
                from the snare which makes you stumble and from talk of vain things.</p>
                <p>He will keep you safe under his feathers and you shall be protected
                beneath His wings,  <br>
                His truth shall enclose you as an armor.</p>
                <p>You shall not be afraid of the terror of the night,  <br>
                Nor of the arrow, which flies by day.</p>
               <p> Nor of the word, which walks in the darkness,  <br>
                Nor of the spirit that destroys at midday.</p>
                <p>Thousands shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand,<br>
                 
                But it shall not come near you.</p>
                <p>But with your eyes alone,<br>  
                You shall see the reward of the wicked,</p>
                <p>Because you have made the Lord your trust,<br>  
                You have made your dwelling in the heights.</p>
                <p>Evil shall not come near you,  <br>
                Affliction shall not come near your tent,</p>
                <p>Because He has commanded his angels concerning you,  <br>
                That they should keep you in all your ways</p>
                <p>and receive you in their arms,  <br>
                That you may not stumble with your foot.</p>
                <p>You shall tread upon the lion and the adder,  <br>
                You shall trample upon the lion cub and the dragon.</p>
                <p>“Because he has cried to me,” says the Lord,  <br>
                “I will deliver him and strengthen him.</p>
                <p>“Because he has known My name, <br>He shall call upon Me and I will
                answer him,<br> I will be with him in distress.</p>
                <p>"I will strengthen him and honor him,  <br>
                I will satisfy him with length of days and show him My salvation.”</p>
                <p>[Psalm 121] I lift my eyes up to the hills,  <br>
                From where will my help come?</p>
                <p>My help is from the Lord,  <br>
                Who made heaven and the earth!</p>
                <p>He will not suffer your foot to slip,  <br>
                Your guardian shall not sleep.</p>
                <p>Indeed, He neither slumbers nor sleeps, <br> 
                The guardian of Isr`a`el.</p>
                <p>The Lord is your guardian,  <br>
                The Lord shall shelter you with His right hand.</p>
                <p>The sun shall not harm you by day,  <br>
                Nor shall the moon harm you by night.</p>
                <p>The Lord shall guard you from all evil, <br> 
                And the Lord shall guard your soul.</p>
                <p>The Lord shall guard your going out,  <br>
                The Lord shall guard your coming in,<br>
                From henceforth and forevermore!</p></p>

praise You.<br><br>

My soul shall be enriched as with marrow and fat / and my mouth
shall praise You with lips of praise.<br><br>
I have remembered You upon my bed / and in the nighttime I have
meditated on You.<br><br>
For You have been my helper / and in the shadow of Your wings is
my protection.<br><br>
My soul follows after You / and Your right hand upholds me.<br><br>
Those who seek to destroy my soul shall enter into the lower parts of
the earth.<br><br>
They shall be delivered over to the sword and shall be food for
foxes; / but the king shall rejoice in God.<br><br>
Everyone who swears by Him shall glory, / but the mouth of those
who speak lies shall be stopped.
