            <h2>Psalm 51</h2>
            <p>
                Have mercy upon me, O God, in Your loving kindness; /
                in the abundance of Your mercy blot out my sin.</p>
                <p>Wash me thoroughly from my guilt and cleanse me from my sin./
                For I acknowledge my fault and my sins are before me always.</p>
                <p>Against You only have I sinned and done evil in Your sight, / that
                You may be justified in Your words and vindicated in Your
                judgment. / For I was born in guilt and in sin did my mother
                conceive me.</p>
                <p>But You take pleasure in truth and You have made known to me the
                secrets of Your wisdom. / Sprinkle me with Your hyssop and I shall
                be clean; / wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
                <p>Give me the comfort of Your joy and gladness, and the bones
                which have been humbled shall rejoice. / Turn away Your face
                from my sins and blot out all my faults.</p>
                <p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, / and renew Your steadfast spirit
                within me. / Do not cast me from Your presence / and take not Your
                Holy Spirit from me.</p>
                <p>But restore to me Your joy and Your salvation / and let Your
                glorious spirit sustain me; / that I may teach the wicked Your way /
                and sinners may return to You.</p>
                <p>Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation / and my
                tongue shall praise Your justice. / O Lord, open my lips and my
                mouth shall sing Your praise.</p>
                <p>For You do not take pleasure in sacrifices; / by burnt offerings You
                are not appeased. / The sacrifice of God is a humble spirit, / a heart
                that is contrite God will not despise.</p>
                <p>Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion and build up the walls of
                Jerusalem. / Then shall You be satisfied with sacrifices of truth and
                with whole burnt-offerings; / then shall they offer bullocks upon
                Your altar.

            <h2>Evening Psalms</h2>
            <p>[Psalm 141] <b>Lord, I have called upon You, / answer me;
                hear and receive my words.</b>
                Let my prayer be like incense in Your sight, / the offering of my
                hands like the evening offering. / Set a guard, Lord, before my
                mouth, /a guard before my lips, / that my heart may not turn to evil
                words /and I may not do deeds of wickedness.
                <p><b>Let me not take salt with impious men; / let the just man teach me
                and reprove me; / let not the oil of the impious anoint my head, /
                because my prayer was against their evil-doing./ Their judges have
                been restrained by the side of the rock, / and they have heard how
                gentle are my words.</b>
                As when a plough cleaves the earth, their bones have been scattered at
                the mouth of Sheol. / I have lifted up my eyes to You, Lord, / and in
                You have I put my trust; /do not cast away my soul.
                <b>Keep me from the hand of the proud, who have laid snares for me; /
                let the wicked fall into their nets, while I pass on.</b>
                <p>[Psalm 142] With my voice I cried to the Lord; / with my voice I
                besought the Lord and poured out my prayer before him; / I showed
                him my affliction when my spirit was troubled, / but You know my
                path.
                <b>In the way of my walking they have laid a snare for me; / I look to
                the right and see none that knows me; / the way of escape has gone
                from me, and there is none who cares for my soul. / I cried to You,
                Lord, and said, / “You are my hope and my portion in the land of
                the living.”</b>
                Hear my petition because I am brought very low; / deliver me from
                my persecutors because they are too strong for me. / Lead me forth
                from prison that I may give thanks to Your name; / Your just ones
                shall have hope when You shall reward me.</p>
                <p>[Psalm 119, 105-112] <b>Your word is a lamp to my feet and light to my
                    path; / I have sworn and am resolved to keep the judgments of Your
                    justice. / I am greatly brought low, Lord, / give me life according to
                    Your word; / be pleased with the words of my mouth, Lord, / and
                    teach me Your judgments.</b>
                    My soul is ever in my hands, and I have not forgotten Your law; /
                    sinners have laid snares for me and I have not strayed from Your
                    commands. / I shall inherit Your testimony forever because it is dear
                    to my heart; / I have turned my heart to do Your commands forever
                    in truth.</p>
                    <p>[Psalm 117] <b>Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise Him, all you
                    peoples; for His grace is strong over us; truly the Lord is forever!</b></p>
                    <p><em>And to you belongs the praise, O God! Barek'mor</em></p>
            <h2>Compline Psalms</h2>
            <p>[Psalm 91] Barekmor. He who sits underthe protection of the Most High,
                 
                And glories in the shelter of God will say to the Lord:
                Barekmor. “My trust is in You,  
                God is my refuge in whom I trust.”
                For the Lord shall deliver you,  
                Fromthe snare which makes you stumble and from talk ofvainthings.
                He will keep you safe under his feathers and you shall be protected
                beneath His wings,  
                His truth shall enclose you as an armor.
                You shall not be afraid of the terror of the night,  
                Nor of the arrow, which flies by day.
                Nor of the word, which walks in the darkness,  
                Nor of the spirit that destroys at midday.
                Thousands shall fall at your side and ten thousand at yourrighthand,
                 
                But it shall not come near you.
                But with your eyes alone,  
                You shall see the reward of the wicked,
                Because you have made the Lord your trust,  
                You have made your dwelling in the heights.
                Evil shall not come near you,  
                Affliction shall not come near your tent,
                Because He has commanded his angels concerning you,  
                That they should keep you in all your ways
                And receive you in their arms,  
                That you may not stumble with your foot.
                You shall tread upon the adder and the basilisk,  
                You shall trample upon the lion and the dragon.
                “Because he has cried to me,” says the Lord,  
                “I will deliver him and strengthen him.
                “Because he has known My name, He shall call upon Me and I will
                answer him,”  
                “I will be with him in distress.
                “I will strengthen him and honor him,  
                I will satisfy him with length of days and show him My salvation.”
                [Psalm 121] I have lifted up my eyes to the hills,  
                From where will my help come?
                My help is from the Lord,  
                Who made heaven and the earth!
                He will not suffer your foot to slip,  
                Your guardian shall not sleep.
                Indeed, He neither slumbers nor sleeps,  
                The guardian of Isr`a`el.
                The Lord is your guardian,  
                The Lord shall shelter you with His right hand.
                The sun shall not harm you by day,  
                Nor shall the moon harm you by night.
                The Lord shall guard you from all evil,  
                And the Lord shall guard your soul.
                The Lord shall guard your going out,  
                The Lord shall guard your coming in,
                From henceforth and forevermore!</p>
            <h2>Midnight Psalms</h2>
            <p>[Psalm 134] Barekmor. Bless the Lord, / all You servants of the Lord,
                Barekmor. You who stand by night in the house of the Lord.
                Lift up your hands to the holy place / and bless the Lord.
                May the Lord bless you from Zion, / He who made heaven and
                earth.
                [Psalm 119, 169-176] Let my praise enter before You, Lord, / and
                give me life by Your word; / let my cry enter before You, Lord, /
                and deliver me by Your word.
                My tongue shall pour forth Your word, / because all Your
                commands are just.
                My lips shall speak Your praise when You have taught me Your
                commands; / let Your hand help me, / because I have taken
                pleasure in Your commands.
                My soul has longed for Your salvation /and I have meditated on
                Your law; / let my soul live and I will praise You /and Your
                judgments shall help me.
                I have gone astray like a lost sheep; / seek for Your servant, /
                because I have not forgotten all Your commands.
                [Psalm 117] Praise the Lord, all you nations; praise Him, all you
                peoples; for His grace is strong over us; truly the Lord is forever!</p>
            <h2>Morning Psalms</h2>
            <p>
                [Psalm 63] My God, You are my God, I will seek You.
My soul thirsts for You and my flesh seeks for You like the thirsty
earth, which is parched and begging for water.
So have I looked for You in truth, that I may see Your power and
Your glory.
Because your loving-kindness is better than life, / my lips shall
praise You.
So I will bless You while I live and will lift up my hands in Your
name.
My soul shall be enriched as with marrow and fat / and my mouth
shall praise You with lips of praise.
I have remembered You upon my bed / and in the nighttime I have
meditated on You.
For You have been my helper / and in the shadow of Your wings is
my protection.
My soul follows after You / and Your right hand upholds me.
Those who seek to destroy my soul shall enter into the lower parts of
the earth.
They shall be delivered over to the sword and shall be food for
foxes; / but the king shall rejoice in God.
Everyone who swears by Him shall glory, / but the mouth of those
who speak lies shall be stopped.
