                Lord God, the Living Word, who surpasses all knowledge, you became fully man, having compassion on your own who were trapped in the nets of Satan.
                Though you dwelt on the earth, at the Unity of Divinity and Humanity, the leaders of the Jews did not recognize you, nor heed your word. 
                O Beautiful One, who came to restore our ancient beauty, you were called unlovely among men. 
                You bore our sins in your body, and healed us, that we might die unto sin and live unto righteousness.
                Without fleeing from bondage or judgement, as fulfillment of prophecy, you gave up your body to rods, your cheek to beatings,
                and your face to spit. You gave up your hands and feet to be fixed by nails, your side to be pierced, your mouth to taste bitter vinegar, 
                and your clothes to be divided. You were hung on the cross of spite. You were counted among the unjust. Thus the Father's will was fulfilled in You.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, we pray to You, O Lord, remove from us all unbearable suffering and sorrow! Grant us complete repentance from evil works, and forgiveness of sins.
                We offer praise and thanksgiving to You, Your Father, and Your Holy Spirit, hosho...

                Thus on this day did Jesus speak<br>

                When they put fear in the people<br>

            <p>O Jesus, the lamb of God<br>
            you first loved me and you bore<br>
            the full burden of my wrongs<br>
            upon your loving shoulders<br>
            With pain you carried the cross<br>
            and then on it were carried<br>
            There you won me forgiveness<br>
            I shall love you forever</p>
            <p class = "right">✠ O Lord, our God...</p>
                <p>I reject sinful pleasures<br>
                for only the Rejected<br>
                has loved me enough to give<br>
                his life for me in my place<br>
                Come and be made glorious<br>
                by his death and by his life<br>
                I live not unto myself<br>
                May you live within me, Lord!

                If I love you till my end<br>
                that is yet a meager gift.<br>
                Let me in the endless world<br>
                love you even past the end<br>
                With hair plaited with lightning<br>
                I shall rejoice and bow down<br>
                I have not loved you till now<br>
                Worthy art thou, who loved me

                You fulfilled upon the cross<br>
                the myst'ries of the prophets<br>
                and won me tranquility<br>
                So I love you forever<br>
                I put on armor of you love<br>
                to repel my enemies<br>
                O Lord, grant me much courage<br>
                let there be praise forever<br>
                To you and to Your Father<br>
                and to the Holy Spirit<br>
