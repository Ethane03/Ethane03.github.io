            <h3>Opening Prayer</h3>
            <p>O Lord our God, who neither slumbers nor sleeps, wake us from our
                deep slumber of sin, so that we may praise Your watchfulness over
                us. Immortal and living God, arouse us from the sleep of death and
                destruction, so that we may adore Your mercy. O Lord, who is the
                Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, because You alone are praised
                and glorified in heaven and on earth, make us also worthy to praise
                and worship You, together with all the majestic angelic hosts who in
                holiness, praise You in heaven.</p>

            <h2>Enyana</h2>
            <p>O God, who willingly embraced death and by Your death, gave life to
                the dead,</p>
                <p>have mercy on us</p>
            <p>O God, who by very nature is life itself, but was buried among the
                dead for our sake</p>
                <p>have mercy on us</p>
            <p>O God, because You are Immortal, and yet died, came back to life,
                and granted us life,</p>
                <p>have mercy on us</p>
            <p>O God, who was placed among the dead like a criminal because of
                sinful Adam,</p>
                <p>have mercy on us</p>
            <p>O God, who remained in the tomb for three days for our salvation,</p>
            <p>have mercy on us</p>
            <p>O God, who by descending to hell, gained victory over death,
                discharged us and cancelled the verdict,</p>
                <p>have mercy on us</p>
            <p>O God, who was buried in the tomb like a dead person, but as God,
                granted life to those who are dead,</p>
                <p>have mercy on us</p>
            <p>O God, who by Your entry into the tomb, brought honour to those
                who had fallen asleep in hell,
            </p>
            <p>have mercy on us</p>

            <p>O Lord of all blessings...</p>
            <p>May we be made worthy...<br>
                O Lord our Messiah, who by very nature is life and the giver of life, the refuge for the dead, the
                resurrection for those buried in the tomb, the delight of those in the
                grave, the radiance that dispels darkness, the solace for the
                distressed, the obliterator of death, the destroyer of hell, the restorer
                of Your image and the upholder of Your creation, You are worthy of
                praise, honour and adoration, at this time of worship and all the days
                of our lives, forever more.
            </p>
            <p>Amen</p>
            <h2>Sedra</h2>
            <p>O Son of the invisible Father, God the Word, who became fully Man
                though without sin, we adore You. Since You are by very nature, life
                itself and You give life, we will always praise You because of Your
                high regard and love for us that made You suffer death on the cross,
                to save us from the death of sin. We worship Your mercy because,
                by Your own will, You lay in the grave to free us from the depths of
                hell, like a Saviour. We praise Your love that made You come down
                unassumingly among the dead, so that we who were destroyed by
                death could live by the glow of the divine light. We honour Your
                compassion that made You come down in person to deliver Adam
                and his descendants who had fallen into the deep pit. We proclaim
                Your enormous grace and divine willingness with which You
                delivered us from the grasp of the oppressor. O Lord, today the
                Church, Your true bride, celebrates the victory of Your death and
                worship Your passion and crucifixion. Our Saviour, Lord and
                Messiah, fulfil the promises to the holy Church. Bless her children.
                Establish her among her future generations. Fill her with abundant
                peace. Enable all her petitions to be fulfilled. May Your right hand be
                upon her. Sustain Your compassion among her children. May Your
                blessings be a refuge, and Your mercy a high fortress for her. Shower
                Your abundant blessings on her. May Your Holy Spirit always dwell
                in her. O only begotten God, she, together with her posterity, in
                complete communion, praise You for Your suffering, death and burial
                for her sake, and worship and adore You, the Father who sent You
                to save us, and the life-giving Holy Spirit, now and forever more.
                </p>
                <p>Amen</p>
            <h2>Ethra</h2>
            <p>Our Lord, the epitome of life, who gave life to the dead by Your salvific
                death, removed the power of sin, and for the saved, transformed it
                into sleep, remove all sinful deeds and completely fill our entire being,
                with a faultless and pure life. Spread the fragrance of good deeds on
                the functioning of our minds. Enable us to praise and thank You, the
                Father and the Holy Spirit, now and forever more.
                </p>
                <p>Amen</p>

            to this moment. In Your mercy, keep us safe from sin and danger
            today and sustain us with Your righteousness. O Lord, because You
            are our only refuge, bestow on us Your perfect love and great mercy.
            Because You are a merciful Lord, teach us Your law and keep us on
            its path. O holy Lord, allow us to shine forth with Your light. Bestow
            upon us all the goodness we need today. You are worthy of praise,
            worship and sovereignty.

            <p>O Most High One, it is good to thank You O Lord, to sing praises to
            Your name, to sing of Your mercies in the morning and to proclaim
            Your faithfulness in the evening. O Lord, listen to our voice in the
            morning; in the morning, we will come prepared to be in Your
            presence. O Lord, have mercy on Your people. O Lord, absolve and
            forgive us all, our sins. O holy One, stretch forth Your right hand upon
            us. In Your holy name, heal us also from the diseases of sin.
            </p>
