            It is good to give thanks to the Lord, O Most High, to sing praises to
            Your name, to sing of Your mercies in the morning and to proclaim
            Your faithfulness in the evening. O Lord, hear our voice in the
            morning; in the morning, we will come prepared to be in Your
            presence. O Lord, have mercy on Your people. O Lord, absolve and
            forgive us all of our sins. O holy One, stretch forth Your right hand upon
            us. By Your holy name, heal us also from the diseases of sin.
