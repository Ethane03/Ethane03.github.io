                Israel was a grapevine brought<br>
                out of Egpyt by pow'r of old<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>He sweetened waters of Marah for her<br>

                At the ninth hour the Lord of Love<br>
                lays hold of the mighty devil<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>Abolishing fears; casting out sorrows<br>

                The graves are opened up to life<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>In the great temple, the curtain is torn<br>

                At the cross a soldier declares<br>
                "Truly He is the Son of God"<br>
                <span class = "tab"></span>The executioner spears Christ in the side<br>

                To fulfill the written word<br>
                In a body came the Lord<br>
                Bearing burdens willingly<br>
                He was numbered among thieves<br>
                Nails tore through His hands and feet<br>

                oppresses the Holy One<br>
                But the greater pain is when<br>
                The Father's face is hidden <br>
                "My God, Eloi", He weeps<br>

                What was stolen by Satan<br>
                is taken back by the Son<br>
                The rich plunder of his schemes<br>
                the Almighty now redeems

                The Father bestows on Him<br>
                Ev'ry blessing in heaven<br>
                The whole world is made His keep<br>
                to its furthest boundary<br>
                Singly has He defeated<br>
                The Devil, Flesh and the World<br>
                By his blood he reconciled<br>

            <p>He cried out "It is finished"<br>
            And soon after bows His head<br>
            To the Father His Spirit<br>
            The faithful Son now commits<br>
