        O Lord, as you removed the just punishment from Ninevah by your mercy, remove evil teaching and disputes from Your church.
        O Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, One True God, have compassion on Your people and answer our appeal by Your mercy.

      To the Knower of secrets, Examiner of the inner senses, Reciever of prayers, Granter of requests, 
      Comforter of the sorrowful, Encourager of the afflicted, Acceptor of sinners, Who gave salvation to the Ninevites by His grace,
      the One who removed harsh punishments from them by His love of mankind, gathered them by His mercy, and entered them into His stable,
      the Comforter of all the broken hearted, is worthy of praise and honor and worship at this time, on all holy days, seasons, and times, and all the days of our lives. Hosho...

        O Lord the Messiah, God our King, Saviour and Redeemer, Who fortold His cross by the sight of the bronze serpent that Moses raised in the desert,
        who by His hand rescued Daniel from the paws of the cruel lions in the deep pit, 
        who saved those children from the terrible furnace, who answered the prophet Jonah's prayer in the belly of the fish,
        because the Ninevites appealed to You, you took away great wrath, agony, and punishment from them, 
        and because of your love of mankind you had mercy on them. O Blessed and Merciful One,
        we supplicate You with sighing and full-body-worship. May you come and save us from wars, strife,
        fire, and storms. Guard us under your wings and consider us always. Remove from us the harsh suffering that destroys our lives.
        May our minds not bear heavy thoughts. May we humble ourselves with the repentance worthy of sinners.
        May our weak spirits obtain perfect help. Our Lord, we take refuge in you and cry out to you. Our Saviour,
        answer unto us. Like the publican, on account of our sin, we do not presume to raise our eyes to your throne. 
        Like the Ninevites, our eyes pour out tears, we turn our gaze to the earth and we make appeal unto you, the Merciful.
        Have mercy on us evildoers. We cry out in grief with lowliness, and await succcor. Be kind to us, for we are sinners.
        May you work in us all your healing wonders and powers. Hand us not over into the hand of our enemies, 
        let us not be despised in secret, nor let us be a song among foreign peoples.
        May you gather us through repentance unto you, carry us in your hands, enter us in your garden.
        We bear praise, glory, and exaltation to you , your Father, and the Holy Spirit. Hosho...

      Our Lord, may the incense of our thanksgiving ascend to the most holy place of your being,
      may the offering of our lips enter the madbaha of your majesty, and may our sacrifice of praise be recieved on the living altar of your mercy.
      May our iniquities recieve absolution from the incense of your love, may our sins be forgiven from your house of praise,
      maay our souls find salvation from the storehouse of your grace, and may we bear praise and thanksgiving to you, hosho...
