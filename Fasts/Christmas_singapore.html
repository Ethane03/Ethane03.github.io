        thanksgiving, glory, adoration and everlasting exaltation. 
        Praise be to You who emerged in accordance with Your own
        holy will, that of Your Father and of the living and Holy Spirit.
        In Your grace, You took pleasure in revealing Yourself, and
        because of Your eternal nature, You sat unnoticeably in the
        lap of Your Father. Although You are above all worlds,
        greater than creation and invisible to the world, because of
        Your love for humanity, You came down and became
        incarnate to be with Your creation. You are the spiritual and
        divine One who was seen on the lap of Your mother and is
        the perfect and heavenly infant who blessed everything
        through Your perfection. At this time, when the worship on
        this feast of Your birth is perfected, and all the days of our
        lives, You are worthy of praise and thanksgiving, forever
        more.

      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>
        In the fulfillment of time, although You created David, You
        were born of the daughter of David. You existed before the
        world and before creation, and You are the ancestor of every
        generation and tribe. You humbly lay in a manger, wrapped
        in swaddling clothes like a pauper, and You were peaceful
        and content in the arms of Mary, the daughter of David. You
        were cuddled by her and grew up like any other infant in
        Bethlehem. O Lord, according to the divine plan, You
        became man without any change in Your godly nature. It is
        Your greatness that made You appear in human form for our
        salvation, and through Your birth, You showered peace and
        unity, and brought reconciliation to those above and below.
        Those in heaven and on earth truly sing praises to Your
        greatness because You gave joy to both the heavenly beings
        and mortals, and demolished the dividing wall of enmity that 
        had separated them. On the day of Your birth, Adam’s race
        received the perfect refuge. Through Your holy will, Your
        creation was illuminated by Your light and darkness was
        removed from every corner of the world. Indeed, the fiery
        angels proclaimed to the shepherds, “Today, in the town of
        David, a Saviour has been born to you; He is the Messiah,
        the Lord.” The shepherds praised You in amazement and
        sang, “Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth and
        goodwill to all humanity.”
      <br><br>
      O wonderful Baby, on this day of Your glorious birth through
      the Virgin Mary, through the prayers that we offer in Your
      holy presence, we plead for Your mercy. O God our Saviour,
      grant us a true understanding of Your amazing incarnation
      that took place for our sake, and enable us to constantly
      thank You for willingly appearing in human form for our
      salvation. Grant us absolution of our debts, forgiveness of
      sins and an enduring reprieve from all the anxieties of our
      body and soul.  
      <br><br>
      O Lord, You are the One who makes sinners truly holy,
      completely sanctifies those who repent, and constantly helps
      and sustains all the children of Your holy Church. Remember
      our parents, brothers and sisters and make us worthy in
      every respect, to joyfully stand at Your right hand and
      experience the jubilation in Your kingdom. We will ascribe
      praise and thanksgiving to You, to Your Father and to the
      Holy Spirit, now and forever more.

        O Lord, the blessed Fruit, holy Root and sweet Fragrance,
        who delighted those far and near and in every corner through
        Your spiritual aroma, abide in the spiritual Bethlehem of our
        souls. Accept these earnest prayers from the temples of our
        hearts. May our innermost being rejoice in the sweet aroma
        of Your love. Enable us to thank You sincerely, celebrate the
        festival of Your birth with joy, and praise You, Your Father
