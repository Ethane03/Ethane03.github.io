        <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>O God the Father, who elected the Holy Virgin Mary as the Mother of your beloved Son, Jesus the Messiah,
          because she renounced all the pleasures of the world, lived in holiness, and was adorned by every goodness, may you accept our prayer and fasting. Grant us grace that
          we might cast off the old man and put on the new, tthat we might lift our minds to where the Messiah dwells at the right hand of God,
          and that on that terrible day when you examine the works of everyone, our prayers might not be for our judgment or condemnation, but for graces and the pardon of sin.

        <h3>Sedra</h3>
        <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>O thou, Mighty God, Lord of all, and our Saviour Jesus the Messiah, you bent down the Most High for the sake of your coming to us,
          You willfully humbled your essence for the Incarnation, and you were seen in the form of humility for the salvation of our mortal race,
          You dwelt in the womb of the Virgin, who was first sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
          The meek and mild Virgin Mary, who is sacred, who is magnified above all,
          who is the physical Mother of God, who is stainless, exalted, and pure, she became Your Mother.
          She recieved Divine Peace from Gabriel, head of the hosts on high. He said to her "The Lord is with thee,
          blessed art thou among women, He shall be born from you". She with her hands celebrated the Lord of heaven and earth, who made her a chariot of Glory.
          She bore the Lord of all. She had been called the Mother of God by the prophets who ministered divine mysteries.
          How worthy is she, out of human nature. The child born of her has recieved perfection at the right hand of God.
          O Lord, who because of your humility took flesh from her, and became a human and infant for our sake,
          keep our race from all punishments and wars, both secret and public. O Lord, encourage our true faith...

          who bore the Saviour of creation, who nursed the Nourisher of nations, who raised the Lord of strength, who carried him who carries the world,
          and who coddled the King of glory. O Child who was born of her, make happy creation by your peace,
          gladden the churches with harmony, take away punishments from us by your grace, remove rods of wrath by your kindness,
          and save and give life to our souls by your mercy. Open our mouths for your praise, loosen our tounges for your thanksgiving,
          and prepare our harp for your honor. By your mercy, accept this incense of spices from our hands, that we 
          might be glorified like Zadoc. May we honor you in a manner befitting you, and may we magnify you in a right manner.
          We bear praise and thanksgiving to you, now and always and forever, hosho...
