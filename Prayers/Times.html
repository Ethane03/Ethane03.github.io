        <h2>In a time of disease and plague</h2>
        <p>O Almighty God, who though You brought plague upon Your own people in wrath, because they oppposed Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,
          still had mercy when they called upon you, and released the plague, may you now remove the rod of your wrath from us sinners,
          who are infected by a great disease. Spread over us the wings of your mercy.
          Grant us forgiveness of sins and compassion. Punish us not as you did Egypt.
          Put us not to shame as you did Babylon. Punish not this land on account of our sins.
          O Lord, stretch out your holy hand and bless us, your people. O Compassionate One, we knock at your door.
          May you remove this disease, this harsh illness from us and make haste to save us, now and always and forever. Amen.
        </p>

        <h2>Kudash Itha</h2>
        <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord, who built Your Church on the Prophets, mended it's flaws by the Apostles, adorned it in heavenly riches, and invited to it both natives and foreigners,
          May your eternal peace remain, O Lord, in your Church that you saved by your cross. Infuse Your love into it. Take away conflict, quarrels, and arguments from it, and make wise the Bishops and Priest to rightly shepherd and rule your sheep whom are saved by your blood. Amen.
        </p>
        <h2>Hudas Itha</h2>
        <p>Guard by your cross, O Lord, the Holy Church and her children. Send to dwell your Church your Holy Spirit who dwelt on the Prophets and Apostles and spoke through them. Give her Lambs food and drink, and seal the Children of the Church with the cross of light. Praise be to the unseen Father who chose the Church, the Son who saved her by His cross, and the Holy Spirit who sanctifies her.</p>
        <h2>Third Sunday</h2>
        <p>O Lord, who announced to Zachariah by your messenger Gabriel, "Your praye has been heard in the presence of God, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son in old age", may you look on us with your mercy, accept our prayer and declare for us too the annunciation of joy. Remove from Your Church heresies and unbelief. Make us worthy to make known your Gospel among the gentiles like your Messenger, and to magnify your holy name. Amen.</p>
