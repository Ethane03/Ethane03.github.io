        <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
        <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
        <h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
        <p>O Lord, our God, we knock at the door of your mercy. We beg for kindness and mercy from your great treasury. O Lord who is our hope, strength, and comfort, we take refuge in you, come to our aid. We confess you, let us not be put to shame. O Lord, forgive us your servants of every sin that we have committed against you, whether  by word, by action, by thought, or by sense. Send us your angel of peace to keep us from the oppresion of the evil on and his hosts. We offer up praise and thanksgiving to you, your Father, and the Holy Spirit, forever, amen.</p>
        <h2>Petition for the Gift of the Holy Spirit</h2>
        <p>O great Lord, without beginning or end, who fulfills truth and promise for those who love Him, who made salvation from sin by your son Jesus the Messiah, life of all, protection of those who take refuge in you, aid to those who seek you, who strengthened us at the third hour by the appearance of tongues of fire by the Holy Spirit, may you give us this Holy gift at all times and make us glorious in it. By him, may we be purified from all public and private sin, and from all thoughts that are hateful to you. May you make us worthy to praise you for all of your graces for us, and to live in your presence with a pure heart and high mind. God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, thou art worthy of praise and thanksgiving forever.</p>
        <h2>Petition</h2>
        <p>O Lord, who came for our salvation in the fulness of time, and who by the cross brought back the forsaken Adam and his Children into your inheritance, have mercy on us. We know not when the end our life is. Nor are we able to perfect ourselves by confession of sin. O Lord, full of mercy and compassion, forgive us of our crimes, our sins, our misdeeds, and evils. Do not alienate us from your grace. Keep not the gift of your Holy Spirit from us. O God, in the time of trial may you be our helper and refuge. O Lord, make us worthy of your grace, and guard our souls. Take us from the attacks and deceits of Satan, that we might not go over to his side. Let us not partake of the punishments and grief that awaits him. O Lord, you spoke in your Evangelion that all who sin are slaves of sin. Surely we have entered into slavery to sin, for we do not abstain from sin and crimes. You have said "Whom the son sets free, is free indeed". Therefore, we appeal to you to send your holy spirit upon us, and rescue us from sin. By the rain of your grace and the dew of your mercy, wash us clean. May we be obedient to you until our last breath.
          Give us grace that, at the time of our death, me might be ministered to by your holy angels, that they might bring our souls with joy to the place of comfort, and that there we might see the righteous with gladness. O Lord, may we receive mercy before your magnificent throne. At the time when you reject many without mercy, may we partake of your mercy. At the judgement when you judge righteously each according to his works, look upon us with kindness and compassion. Make us worthy to gather around you then with bright faces. Let us not be handed over to the hand of the enemy,
          nor forsake us and give us over to the hands of those who oppose our souls. Rather, remove from us our dirty clothes, that we may not be cast into the outer darkness with those who are unworthy of the feast. May our lamps shine with the oil of good works, that we might not be cast out like the foolish virgins. Let us never hear that word of despair "I know you not", with those at your left side. Save us by the blood your shed for us. Make us live according to your grace, that we might sing praise to you forever in your Kingdom. Amen
