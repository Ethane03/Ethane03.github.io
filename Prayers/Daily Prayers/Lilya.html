      <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
      <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
      <h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
      <p>Praise be to you, O God, full of mercy and blessing, for you have woken us from sleep to praise your grace.
      Purify our lips, O God, to sing songs of praise to you.
      Have mercy on us unworthy and declare blessings over us, O Lord who was born as a man and loves mankind.
      We are unworthy and drowning in sin. O Lord, who walked on the sea before your disciples and loves mankind,
      pull us out of the sea of sin and bless us.</p>

      <h2>Petition</h2>
      <p>O God, I raise my hands to you.<br>

        Like a servant to his master, I raised my eyes to you. O God, you are the Creator and I am your creature. O God, you are the King and I am your servant. O God, you are great, and I, lowly. You are mighty and I, weak. You are the One who forgives, and I, the sinner. You are wise, and I, ignorant and foolish. You are the One who gives, and I, the one who begs from you. You are eternal, and, I am fleeting.<br>
        
        By your holy will you created me and taught me your holy name. In accordance with your instruction, I call upon you. Grave sinner though I am, I call upon you. Answer me, O Lord, and bless me.<br>
        
        O God, remove from me the sleep of evil and, on account of your perfect and just commandments, grant me the grace to meditate upon your holy name and vigilantly offer thanksgiving to you. O lover of mankind, I entreat you: allow me not to sleep the sleep of evil, but purify my heart and lead me away from evil dreams.<br>
        
        Grant me the grace to follow your commandments to meditate on your just decrees during the day, and to fulfill your will.<br>
        
        Rescue me from sinful and dark deeds and deliver me from the grip of the evil one. Grant me a portion with your saints and make me a child of the light. Purify and adorn my soul that 1 might praise and honor you always.<br>
        
        I knock at the door of your mercy, O Lord, who dwell in a glorious mansion of light upon which the myriads of the heavenly host cannot look. Open the gate of your mercy to my petitions and receive my prayer in your bountiful presence. O Lord Jesus Christ, ocean of love and mercy who enrich the poor, pour forth upon me, your grace in abundance.<br>
        
        O Lord, answer my petition. Remove my blindness and allow me to see. Make me worthy to rejoice in the wonderful knowledge of the economy of salvation of my Lord and God, Jesus Christ. O God the Father, the Good One, who bless, sanctify and bring everything to completion, make me worthy to praise you unceasingly, and your Only-begotten Son, and Holy Spirit, now and always and forever. Amen</p>
