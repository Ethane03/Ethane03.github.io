          Lord, may you accept our prayer as a pleasing scent in your presence,
          and the spreading of our hands like the evening offering.
          O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, may you make us worthy to worship you with fearful devotion,
          and to praise and glorify you with purity and holiness. Hasha... Amen

        <h2>Petition</h2>
        <p>O Lord, full of mercy and grace, who by your life giving passion and death you loosed us from the bonds of sin and destroyed the power of death, 
           who by the medicine of your indiminishable act of salvation triumphed over the wisdom of sages, and the false knowledge of teachers.
           who by the power of your saving cross broke the doors of Sheol and rescued Adam and his children,
           have mercy on us. Gracious Lord, may your clothe us in the armour of your victorious cross that we might survive the temptation of the evil one.
           Grant us the grace of your Holy Spirit, that me might serve you in truth and righteousness all the days of our lives.
           May your sanctify us with the gifts of mercy and grace, O Lord, for you know the weakness of our race.
           Rescue us from all unrighteousness, and grant us fearful devotion to you to do your will.
           Remember us, Our Lord, when your come into your kingdom.
           As you had mercy to the theif at your right, have mercy on us also.
           Make us worthy, O Lord, of blessings and pardon of sin.
           Save us from the evil one and his trials and battles.
           You are merciful, and you accept the petition of sinners and mercifully bless them.
           Therefore may we be made worthy to bear praise forever to You, your Father, and your Holy Spirit.
           Hosho...

        <h2>Masmur (Psalm 141)</h2>
        <p>
Lord, I call to you; come to me quickly; <br>
hear my voice when I cry to you.<br>
Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense,<br>
the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.<br>
Set a watch before my mouth, O Lord,<br>
and guard the door of my lips; <br>
let not my heart incline to any evil thing.<br>
Let me not be occupied in wickedness with evildoers, <br>
nor eat of their choice foods.<br>
Let the righteous smite me in friendly rebuke;<br>
let not the oil of the unrighteous anoint my head; <br>
for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.<br>
Let their rulers be overthrown in stony places, <br>
that they may know my words are true.<br>
As when a plowman turns over the earth in furrows, <br>
let their bones be scattered at the mouth of the grave.<br>
But my eyes are turned to you, Lord God; <br>
in you I take refuge;<br>
do not strip me of my life.<br>
Protect me from the snare which they have laid for me <br>
and from the traps of the evildoers.<br>
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, <br>
while I myself escape.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Glory be...</p>
        <p>As it was...</p>
