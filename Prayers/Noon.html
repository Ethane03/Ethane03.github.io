        <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
        <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
        <h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
        <p>O Lord God omnipotent, we thank you and worship you, for the times of the sufferings of your only son have been made for us times of petition and comfort. At this time O Lord, accept our prayer and supplication.</p>
        <h2>Petition</h2>
        <p>O Lord, who was crufified by your own will for our sins, at the sixth hour of the sixth day, may you tear up the record of our sins,
          for your are our Saviour. O Lord, who was hung on a cross for our sake, who fixed sin to that tree, and gave life to Adam in the grace,
          by your life-giving sufferings and by the nails which fixed you to the cross, may you put to death the evil thought and evil desires in us.
          Thou art the God of mercy, therefore ever keep in our minds the remembrance of your righteous judgement. O Jesus Messiah, our Lord, your unworthy servants
          give thanks to you and pray and appeal to you by your grace.</p>
        <h2>Lord's Prayer</h2>

Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
