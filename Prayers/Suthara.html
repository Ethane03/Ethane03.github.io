      <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

      <p>Hide us, O Lord, under the wings of your mercy. Help us to find rest in you at the end of our lives,

        Lead us to this true knowledge of life.
        God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we ever bear praise and thanksgiving unto you, hosho...

      <p>Our Lord God, I pray to thee <br> I keep watch tonight, alone<br> You have commanded to me<br> Stand awake before thy throne</p>
      <p>Should I fall asleep again<br> May the sleep of your servant <br>Be peaceful and without sin <br>Before your holy presence</p>
      <p>If I sin while I’m awake <br>Or err while I am sleeping <br>Give to me thy holy grace <br>O Lord! Have mercy on me</p>
      <p>By the peace of your great cross<br> May you give me blessed sleep<br> From nightmares that make me toss <br>O Lord may you rescue me</p>
      <p>Give to me a peaceful night<br> With a calm and quiet sleep <br>May you destroy all the might <br>Of evil and treachery</p>
      <p>When I go to sleep tonight<br> As I serve you faithfully<br> Send to me an angel bright <br>To watch over my body</p>
      <p>From all hateful desires<br> Make haste, Lord, to rescue me <br>For I have partaken of <br>Your own life-giving body</p>
      <p>When I go to sleep in peace<br> May you have mercy and give<br> Your blood to all creation<br> As refuge and medicine</p>
      <p>May I reign at your right hand<br> In a body you have formed<br> May your mercies stand round me<br> As the walls of a fortress</p>

      <p>O Lord who nourishes me <br>I shall beseech you only <br>Let the evil one not come <br>aside my bed as I sleep</p>
      <p>So that I could live with strength<br> You lived as a burnt off’ring <br>May you rebuke the devil <br>Who desires to destroy me</p>
      <p>O Lord, may you bring to pass<br> Your promise inside of me<br> By your death upon the cross <br>May you protect my whole life</p>
      <p>During the time that I sleep <br>Let me understand your love <br>So that at my waking hour<br> I might celebrate your name</p>
      <p>I have known your holy will<br> So declare goodness for me<br> That I might follow it well <br>By your kindness and mercy</p>
      <p>Declare for your servants, <br>Lord That they might sleep righteously <br>And enter the peaceful end<br> O our Savior Messiah!</p>
      <p>For you are the Light of lights<br> And your dwelling is the Light<br> All the children of the Light<br> Worship and bow down to you</p>
      <p>Praise to you, may your mercies <br>Rest upon all your servants <br>May it be so in this world <br>And in the coming world too</p>
      <p>O my Lord, praise be to you <br>Praise be to you, praise to you<br> Thousands upon thousands more <br>Innum’rable praises be</p>

      <h2>Masmur(Psalm) 91</h2>
      <p>You, that sit in the shelter of the Most High, and abide in glory, in the shadow of God.
        Say to the Lord: 'My trust and my refuge; the God in whom I confide.'
        For He shall deliver you from the snare of stumbling, and from idle talk.
        He shall keep you under His feathers, and by His wings, you shall be covered; and His truth shall encompass you like an armor.
        You shall not fear from the terror by night, and from the arrow that flies by the day:
        And from the voice that travels in the darkness, and from the devastating wind in the noon.
        Thousands shall fall at your side, and ten thousands at your right side. They shall not come near to you, but with your eyes you shall see only; You shall see the revenge of the wicked.
        (Since you have said), 'Thou art the Lord, my trust, who hast placed Thy abode in the heights.'
        There shall no evil come near to you; neither shall any plague draw near to your dwelling place.
        For He shall give His angels command concerning you, who shall protect you in all your ways.
        And they shall bear you up in their hands, lest your foot stumble.
        You shall tread upon the adder and the basilisk; and you shall trample down the lion and the dragon.
        (For the Lord has said): 'Since he has sought me, I will deliver him and strengthen him;'
        'Since he has known my name he shall call upon me, and I will answer him, and be with him in affliction.' I will strengthen him and honor him. With long life, will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.</p>
      <p>Glory be...</p>
      <p>As it was...</p>
      <h2>Prayer of St. Severus</h2>
<p>O Lord who sittest in the secret place of the Most High, shelter us beneath the shadow of the wings of Thy mercy, and have compassion upon us.
  Thou, who hearest all things, in Thy loving kindness, hearken to the supplications of Thy servants.
  Grant us, O Messiah; our Savior; a peaceful evening and a sinless night, for Thou art a glorious king, and unto Thee, are our eyes lifted up.
  Forgive our debts and our sins; have mercy upon us, both in this world and in that to come.
  May Thy loving kindness shelter us O Lord, and Thy grace be upon our faces. May Thy cross protect us from the evil one and his hosts.
  Let Thy right hand overshadow us all the days of our lives, and Thy peace reign among us, do Thou give hope and salvation to the souls that pray to Thee.
  By the prayers of St. Mary, Thy Mother, and of all Thy Saints, O God, forgive us our debts, and have mercy upon us. Amen.</p>

      <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
      <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
      <h2>Nicene Creed</h2>
      <p>We believe in one true God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth and all things visible and invisible. 
        <br><br>We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God, begotten of the Father before all world. Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made, Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man. He was crucified also for us in the days of Pontius Pilate, suffered and died and was buried. The third day He rose again by his Father’s Holy will, ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. He will come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead and of his Kingdom there will be no end.
        <br><br>
        We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets and apostles.
        <br><br>
        We believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church; we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins and look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the new life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
