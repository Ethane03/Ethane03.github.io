      <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
      <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
      <h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
      <p>Hide us, O Lord, under the wings of your mercy. Help us to find rest in you at the end of our lives,
        just as we now rest from labors and come into your presence.
        Lead us to this true knowledge of life.
        God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we ever bear praise and thanksgiving unto you, hosho...

      <p class = "subtitle">(Shayana Namaksaram)</p>
      <p>Our Lord God, I pray to thee <br> I keep watch tonight, alone<br> You have commanded to me<br> Stand awake before thy throne</p>
      <p>Should I fall asleep again<br> May the sleep of your servant <br>Be peaceful and without sin <br>Before your holy presence</p>
      <p>If I sin while I’m awake <br>Or err while I am sleeping <br>Give to me thy holy grace <br>O Lord! Have mercy on me</p>
      <p>By the peace of your great cross<br> May you give me blessed sleep<br> From nightmares that make me toss <br>O Lord may you rescue me</p>
      <p>Give to me a peaceful night<br> With a calm and quiet sleep <br>May you destroy all the might <br>Of evil and treachery</p>
      <p>When I go to sleep tonight<br> As I serve you faithfully<br> Send to me an angel bright <br>To watch over my body</p>
      <p>From all hateful desires<br> Make haste, Lord, to rescue me <br>For I have partaken of <br>Your own life-giving body</p>
      <p>When I go to sleep in peace<br> May you have mercy and give<br> Your blood to all creation<br> As refuge and medicine</p>
      <p>May I reign at your right hand<br> In a body you have formed<br> May your mercies stand round me<br> As the walls of a fortress</p>
      <p>When I lay down into sleep<br> Your strength is a good watchman <br>May my sleep be like incense <br>rising up before your throne</p>
      <p>O Lord who nourishes me <br>I shall beseech you only <br>Let the evil one not come <br>aside my bed as I sleep</p>
      <p>So that I could live with strength<br> You lived as a burnt off’ring <br>May you rebuke the devil <br>Who desires to destroy me</p>
      <p>O Lord, may you bring to pass<br> Your promise inside of me<br> By your death upon the cross <br>May you protect my whole life</p>
      <p>During the time that I sleep <br>Let me understand your love <br>So that at my waking hour<br> I might celebrate your name</p>
      <p>I have known your holy will<br> So declare goodness for me<br> That I might follow it well <br>By your kindness and mercy</p>
      <p>Declare for your servants, <br>Lord That they might sleep righteously <br>And enter the peaceful end<br> O our Savior Messiah!</p>
      <p>For you are the Light of lights<br> And your dwelling is the Light<br> All the children of the Light<br> Worship and bow down to you</p>
      <p>Praise to you, may your mercies <br>Rest upon all your servants <br>May it be so in this world <br>And in the coming world too</p>
      <p>O my Lord, praise be to you <br>Praise be to you, praise to you<br> Thousands upon thousands more <br>Innum’rable praises be</p>
      <p>O Hearer of our prayers <br>O Granter of petitions <br>Having listened to our pray’r<br> May you grant our petitions</p>
