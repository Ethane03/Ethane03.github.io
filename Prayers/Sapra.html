      <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
      <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
      <h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
      <p>O Lord our God, sleepless and wakeful, may you awaken us from the deep
        slumber of sin, so that we may praise your watchfulness over us. O Living
        Immortal, raise us up from the sleep of death and destruction, so that we
        may adore your mercy. O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you alone are
        worshipped and glorified in heaven and on earth, therefore, make us worthy
        to worship and glorify you along with the ranks of angels who praise you
        with purity in heaven. Amen</p>
      <h2>Enyana</h2>
      <p>O God who so loved the world, as to send your beloved son into it for us sinners.</p>
      <p>Bless art thou and worshipped</p>
      <p>O Messiah, who by your suffering for us and by your death on the cross, saved us from all wickedness</p>
      <p>Bless art thou and worshipped</p>
      <p>O God the Holy Sprit, who by your mysterious power rescues us from all the stains of sin</p>
      <p>Bless art thou and worshipped</p>

      <p>Bless art thou and worshipped</p>
      <h2>Masmur 51</h2>
      <p>Have mercy upon me, Oh God, according to Your loving-kindness; according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
        <br>
        Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sins; For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. I have sinned against You, against You truly. I have done what is evil in Your sight. Your judgments are right. Your sentence is just. For behold, I was formed in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
        <br>
        But You take delight in the truth. You have made known to me the secrets of Your wisdom. Sprinkle me with Your hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
        <br>
        Satisfy me with Your joy and gladness, that my bones, which are crushed, shall rejoice. Turn Your face away from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
        <br>
        Create in me a pure heart, Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Your presence; and take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
        <br>
        Restore to me the joy of Your salvation; and uphold me with Your glorious spirit; then I will teach the wicked Your way, and sinners shall turn to You.
        <br>
        Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, Oh God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue shall praise Your righteousness. Oh Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall sing Your praises.
        <br>
        For You do not desire sacrifices, You are not appeased by burnt offerings. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, Oh God, which You will not despise.
        <br>
        By Your loving-kindness do good to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem. Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then they shall offer bullocks upon Your altar.
        <br>
        To You belongs praise, Oh God. Barek'mor</p>
      <h2>Petition of Mar Balai</h2>
      <p>O God who is merciful to sinners, have mercy on us in your judgement.
         May you forgive our crimes on account of the abundance of your zealous love. <br><br>

      <h2>Prayer</h2>
      <p>It is good to give thanks to the Lord, O Most High, and to sing to your holy name, and to proclaim your grace in the morning and your steadfastness through the night.
        O Lord, hear our voice in the morning. We gather together in the morning and are seen by you. Have mercy on your people, O Lord. 
        Pardon and forgive the sins of all of us, O Lord. O Holy One, may your right hand dwell over us. May we me healed from the diseases of our sins on account of your holy name. Amen.

      <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
      <h2>Nicene Creed</h2>
      <p>We believe in one true God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth and all things visible and invisible. 
        <br><br>We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God, begotten of the Father before all world. Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made, Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man. He was crucified also for us in the days of Pontius Pilate, suffered and died and was buried. The third day He rose again by his Father’s Holy will, ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. He will come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead and of his Kingdom there will be no end.
        <br><br>
        We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets and apostles.
        <br><br>
        We believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church; we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins and look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the new life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
