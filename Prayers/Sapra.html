      <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
      <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
      <h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
      <p>O Lord our God, sleepless and wakeful, may you awaken us from the deep
        slumber of sin, so that we may praise your watchfulness over us. O Living
        Immortal, raise us up from the sleep of death and destruction, so that we
        may adore your mercy. O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you alone are
        worshipped and glorified in heaven and on earth, therefore, make us worthy
        to worship and glorify you along with the ranks of angels who praise you
        with purity in heaven. Amen</p>

      <p>Bless art thou and worshipped</p>
      <h2>Masmur 51</h2>
      <p>Have mercy upon me, Oh God, according to Your loving-kindness; according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
        <br>
        Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sins; For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. I have sinned against You, against You truly. I have done what is evil in Your sight. Your judgments are right. Your sentence is just. For behold, I was formed in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
        <br>
        But You take delight in the truth. You have made known to me the secrets of Your wisdom. Sprinkle me with Your hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
        <br>
        Satisfy me with Your joy and gladness, that my bones, which are crushed, shall rejoice. Turn Your face away from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
        <br>
        Create in me a pure heart, Oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Your presence; and take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
        <br>
        Restore to me the joy of Your salvation; and uphold me with Your glorious spirit; then I will teach the wicked Your way, and sinners shall turn to You.
        <br>
        Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, Oh God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue shall praise Your righteousness. Oh Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall sing Your praises.
        <br>
        For You do not desire sacrifices, You are not appeased by burnt offerings. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, Oh God, which You will not despise.
        <br>
        By Your loving-kindness do good to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem. Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then they shall offer bullocks upon Your altar.
        <br>
        To You belongs praise, Oh God. Barek'mor</p>

      <h2>Prayer</h2>
      <p>It is good to give thanks to the Lord, O Most High, and to sing to your holy name, and to proclaim your grace in the morning and your steadfastness through the night.
        O Lord, hear our voice in the morning. We gather together in the morning and are seen by you. Have mercy on your people, O Lord. 
        Pardon and forgive the sins of all of us, O Lord. O Holy One, may your right hand dwell over us. May we be healed from the diseases of our sins on account of your holy name. Amen.

      <h2>Prayer</h2>
      <p>
      O Lord, omnipotent and great in mercy, you alone are the true physician of souls. 
      We all desire to know you and to obtain comfort in you.
      Yet we have sinned against you. We have greatly grieved you.
      Our hearts and our flesh are soaked in sin. We have become like the dead.
      We are unable to bring ourselves back to life. 
      We know, O Lord, that we are worthy of great punishment and that we are unable to answer for our misdeeds.
      We acknowledge that even if the whole world were to appeal for us, we cannot live without your grace.
      Therefore we pray to your grace. O Lord, rebuke us not in your anger, punish us not in your wrath, and send us not to agony in righteous judgement.
      We are fearful even to look toward heaven, for our face is filled with shame. We cry out in your presence with a broken heart and a humble spirit, like the publican.
      Accept up, O Lord, like the prodigal son. Forgive us, O Lord, as you did Simon who abandoned You.
      Praise be to you, O Lord, for you have given us your holy body as food, and your life-giving blood as drink.
      Rebuke not us who bear your holy name. Do not judge us and send us to dwell in darkness, in harsh agony along with the evil ones.
      You are merciful and compassionate, and you do not delight in the death of a sinner. Therefore, according to your innumerable mercies, have compassion for us great sinners and have mercy on us.
      Forgive us, O Lord, of the wrongs and misdeeds that we have commited in your presence.
      O Lord, open the door of your mercy which is closed against us on account of the sin we commited.
      Let thy holy face shine, O Lord, on us great sinners who dwell in darkness and in the shadow of death.
      Let your mercy stand before us at this time. O Lord, we are mighty sinners and drenched in all evil. Therefore accept us wrathful criminals.
      O Lord, make us worthy that on the day that you come in glory, we might stand at your right hand with the saints who have repented and acheived perfection, like the servants at the eleventh hour,
      and praise you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit forever.
</p>
      <h2>Petition</h2>
      <p>O God our Father, Lord of all, we praise you for bringing us in health up until this time. May you guard us today by your mercy from sin and misfortune, and care for us in righteousness. O Lord, may your loving-kindness and mercy be upon us, for our refuge is in you only. May you teach us your commandments and lead us in them, for you are the Lord of Grace. O Holy Lord, enlighten us with your light. On this day, rain down every goodness necessary for us. You are worthy of praise and honor and authority. Amen</p>

      <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
      <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
      <h2>Nicene Creed</h2>
      <p>We believe in one true God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth and all things visible and invisible. 
        <br><br>We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God, begotten of the Father before all world. Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made, Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man. He was crucified also for us in the days of Pontius Pilate, suffered and died and was buried. The third day He rose again by his Father’s Holy will, ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. He will come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead and of his Kingdom there will be no end.
        <br><br>
        We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets and apostles.
        <br><br>
        We believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church; we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins and look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the new life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
