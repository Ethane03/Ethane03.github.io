      <h2>Petition of Mar Balai</h2>
      <p>O God who is merciful to sinners, have mercy on us in your judgement.
         May you forgive our crimes on account of the abundance of your zealous love. <br><br>
       
        We are sorely oppressed, O Merciful One, and we knock at your door.
        May you grant our requests by your blessing. <br><br>
        
        O Jesus the Messiah, full of mercy, you grant blessing if the criminal turns and prays in sorrow.
        Therefore, may you open to us the door of your blessings.<br><br>

        We pray to you, O Heavenly Father. May you accept our service and bless us.<br><br>

        Praise be to him who declared "Call and I will answer, knock and I will open, ask and I shall give".<br><br>

        O Lord, Master of those above, and Comfort of those below, may you accept our service and bless us. Amen.

      <h2>Nicene Creed</h2>
      <p>We believe in one true God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth and all things visible and invisible. 
        <br><br>We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God, begotten of the Father before all world. Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made, Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man. He was crucified also for us in the days of Pontius Pilate, suffered and died and was buried. The third day He rose again by his Father’s Holy will, ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father. He will come again with glory to judge both the living and the dead and of his Kingdom there will be no end.
        <br><br>
        We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets and apostles.
        <br><br>
        We believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church; we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins and look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the new life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
