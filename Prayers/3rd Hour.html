        <h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
        <p> Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen</p>
        <h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
        <h2>Petition for the Gift of the Holy Spirit</h2>
        <p>O great Lord, without beginning or end, who fulfills truth and promise for those who love Him, who made salvation from sin by your son Jesus the Messiah, life of all, protection of those who take refuge in you, aid to those who seek you, who strengthened us at the third hour by the appearance of tongues of fire by the Holy Spirit, may you give us this Holy gift at all times and make us glorious in it. By him, may we be purified from all public and private sin, and from all thoughts that are hateful to you. May you make us worthy to praise you for all of your graces for us, and to live in your presence with a pure heart and high mind. God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, thou art worthy of praise and thanksgiving forever.</p>
