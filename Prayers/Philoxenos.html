        <p class = "subtitle">Recite the following prayers according to each day</p>
        <h4>Sunday</h4>
        <p>O my God and my Saviour, have grace on me, and forgive my sins. Wash away my stains and remit my debts. Make haste to save me from attacks of cursed devils, from the troubles of evil men, from wretched emotions, from abominable desires, from demonic thoughts, from foolish dreams, from useless conversation, from dangerous paths, from the way of destruction, from transgression by sin, from evil speech, from conversation with fools, and from everything that separates me from your love. O Lord, who rescues everyone who calls upon you with all their heart and who takes refuge in you, do not rebuke me in your righteousness and do not punish in your anger. Have mercy on me by your grace, and help me by your kindness. May you save me from every sin I have committed in your presence and incur your wrath by. O Most High, who rules everything by your grace, have mercy on me on account of your uncountable graces and make haste to save me. Amen.</p>
        <h4>Monday</h4>
        <p>O God, I do not deny your grace. I do not reject the good gifts you have given to me. I confess and believe that your grace is firm above my head. I confess my sins like the sinful woman. Forgive my sins like you did hers. I acknowledge my iniquities like the Canaanite woman. Accept me as you accepted her. I confess that I have angered you in thought, word, and deed all the days of my life. O Lord, I turn back to you now, therefore make me like one of the penitents of your holy church, your holy church that you had mercy on by your grace and made righteous by your blessing. O Lord wipe away my sins, wash away my stains, save me from guilt. Sprinkle over me the water of your grace and the hyssop of your mercy, and make me clean. Renew a clean heart in me that praises you without ceasing. Make me worthy to praise you alongside the righteous, day and night and at all times. Amen</p>
        <h4>Tuesday</h4>
        <p>O God who made tax collectors and those living in lawlessness into righteous people, forgive me of my sins. O redeemer of thieves and those who have fallen away, return me to your righteousness. O God who said “Knock, and it shall be opened to you”, open thy door for me. O God who forgets not the cries of beggars, forget not the cry of me, a sinner. O God who gives aid to all who take refuge in you, reach out with your right hand and help me. O God, who does not reject the plea of the distressed, reject not the plea of my poverty. O God who does not send away the brokenhearted, send me not away from your presence. O God who does not abandon his own creation, do not abandon me. O God who is near to the brokenhearted, take my soul and add it into your salvation. O God who does not destroy the refuge of the lost, destroy not the refuge of my heart. O Lord, draw me close to you, let me not fall into the hands of the liar, into the hands of the enemy. Make me righteous like the tax collector, accept me like the thief, bring me into your flock. Wash me like the sinful woman. Enlighten my darkness with the light of your knowledge. Forgive me of all the sins which I have committed in your presence, knowingly and unknowingly. As you forgive me of my trespasses, give me grace to forgive those who have trespassed against me. Amen</p>
        <h4>Wednesday</h4>
        <p>O Lord, make this morning a morning of blessing and comfort and the dawn of a joyful day, on this day make haste to save me from evil men, from cheating neighbors, from the attacks of Satan,  from evil times, from destructive sights, from harm, from false words, from idle conversation, from unknown errors, from the opposition of the enemy, from impure commerce, and from abominable emotions. O my Lord, give me a disciplined body, a pure tongue, and controlled thoughts. May you give to me all the things that are helpful to my spirit, and pleasing to your lordship. May you nourish me with sufficient food, useful riches, and protection of my soul. O my Lord, make me worthy so that I may hate violence, leave behind wickedness, to abstain from sin, to be removed from evil, to be obedient to my parents, to be subject to my teachers, to be favorable to my friends, to respect my brothers and sisters, and to glorify your holy name in all that I do. Amen.</p>
        <h4>Thursday</h4>
        <p>O my Lord, behold, I have stretched out my arms to you, and my eyes seek your mercy. I call upon you and plead with you and take comfort in you. Do not forget me, do not abandon me! Let me not be scorned by those who hate me, let me not be ridiculed by those who scorn me. Let not Satan rejoice in my sin, nor the jealous one grow haughty in my mistakes. Let me not go out from your sheepfold, let me not stray from your path, let me not leave your way. Remove not your grace from me, and send me not out from under your wings. May you care for me by your mercifulness and make me one of your people, and clean and purify me and rescue me. Amen</p>
        <h4>Friday</h4>
        <p>You who sits at the right hand of the Father, may you seat me at thy right hand. Place the greatness of your mercy above me. Forgive me, You who are rich in forgiveness, grace, and holiness. You who calmed the waves of the angry sea, calm the waves of my sinful emotions. You who art close to the brokenhearted, draw my soul close to you. O forgiver of sins and iniquities, forgive my sins and iniquities. O Protector of Your own servants, guard my words and lips and heart so that I may not speak or do or think evil. May my thoughts and emotions and works and my conduct and my everything be led toward goodness. Amen</p>
        <h4>Saturday</h4>
        <p>O my Lord, I have placed my shelter on you, I take refuge in you. I call upon you and pray to you. I plead without ceasing for healing for my pain and remission of my debts. O my Lord, make me worthy to keep your commandments, to dwell in your court, and to receive your mercifulness. O my Lord, give me grace to live in this world a life apart from abominable things and without sin. Make me worthy of the end that peaceful men have. May you give me grace to be seen kindly before your terrible throne. May you make me worthy of the joyful experience of goodness, and the throne room of happiness. Amen</p>
