    <h1>Monday Prayers</h1>
    <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>O Lord God at this time (when we complete the day and enter into evening) may our prayer and supplication be pleasing to you as we bow before you in worship. O Lord, by your abundant goodness, grant forgiveness for our sins, pardon for our guilt, health for our bodies, and deliverance for our souls. We beseech you for mercy and goodwill from your magnificent house. O Lord, bless us, and perfect us in your glory. We bear praises unto you and your Father and your Holy Spirit forever. Hosho Vab’kula suban l’olmeen</p></div></div>
    <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>Amen</p></div></div>
    <h2>Psalm 32</h2>
    <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>Happy are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sin is put away! Happy are they to whom the Lord imputes no guilt, and in whose spirit there is no guile! While I held my tongue, my bones withered away, because of my groaning all day long. For your hand was heavy upon me day and night; my moisture was dried up as in the heat of summer. Then I acknowledged my sin to you, and did not conceal my guilt. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord." Then you forgave me the guilt of my sin. Therefore all the faithful will make their prayers to you in time of trouble; when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach them. You are my hiding-place; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with shouts of deliverance. I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go; I will guide you with my eye. Do not be like horse or mule, which have no understanding; who must be fitted with bit and bridle, or else they will not stay near you. Great are the tribulations of the wicked;  but mercy embraces those who trust in the Lord. Be glad, you righteous, and rejoice in the Lord;  shout for joy, all who are true of heart.</p></div></div>

O Lord, come now to help us, your servants. For you alone are pure, O God, you alone are the victor. O Lord, wipe away the sins and iniquities of your servants who stand before you. O Lord, accept us sinners as you accepted the sinful woman, and forgive all our wrongdoings. O Lord, forgive all the sins that we have committed before you, whether intentionally or unintentionally, knowingly or unknowingly, by command, by fraud, by scheming, by thoughts of our heart, by conversation, by word, or by deed. O Lord Messiah who came to die on a cross for virtue and for the salvation of our race, forgive our mistakes and our iniquities. O Lord, give everything necessitated by this present life to everyone. May you decorate the year with fitting seasons, whether rain or snow, summer or monsoon. O Lord, increase all the treasures and fruits of the earth so that the impoverished may eat and be filled, and praise you, the protector of all, with the sound of worship. O Lord, give peace and good-will to this world, and escape from evil and leave from difficulties to those who are in it. May you save the persecuted, the troubled, the foreigners, those who are grieving, and those who are hated and persecuted by the unrighteous. O Lord, have mercy on your people and be kind unto your inheritance. Make us all worthy of your heavenly home. Free our spirits from the stains of sin. We stand at your right hand with your elect, therefore we bring praise and worship to you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit. Hosho Vab’kula Suban L’olmeen</p></div></div>

O Lord wipe away my sins, wash away my stains, save me from guilt. Sprinkle over me the water of your grace and the hyssop of your mercy, and make me clean. Renew a clean heart in me that praises you without ceasing. Make me worthy to praise you alongside the righteous, day and night and at all times. Amen</p></div></div>
