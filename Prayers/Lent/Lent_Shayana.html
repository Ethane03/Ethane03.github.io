        <h2>Shayana Namaskaram</h2>
    <p class = "subtitle">(St. Ephrem’s prayer of rest)</p>
    <p>Our Lord God, I pray to thee <br> I keep watch tonight, alone<br> You have commanded to me<br> Stand awake before thy throne</p>
    <p>Should I fall asleep again<br> May the sleep of your servant <br>Be peaceful and without sin <br>Before your holy presence</p>
    <p>If I sin while I’m awake <br>Or err while I am sleeping <br>Give to me thy holy grace <br>O Lord! Have mercy on me</p>
    <p>By the peace of your great cross<br> May you give me blessed sleep<br> From nightmares that make me toss <br>O Lord may you rescue me</p>
    <p>Give to me a peaceful night<br> With a calm and quiet sleep <br>May you destroy all the might <br>Of evil and treachery</p>
    <p>When I go to sleep tonight<br> As I serve you faithfully<br> Send to me an angel bright <br>To watch over my body</p>
    <p>From all hateful desires<br> Make haste, Lord, to rescue me <br>For I have partaken of <br>Your own life-giving body</p>
    <p>When I go to sleep in peace<br> May you have mercy and give<br> Your blood to all creation<br> As refuge and medicine</p>
    <p>May I reign at your right hand<br> In a body you have formed<br> May your mercies stand round me<br> As the walls of a fortress</p>
    <p>When I lie down into sleep<br> Your strength is a good watchman <br>May my sleep be like incense <br>rising up before your throne</p>
    <p>O Lord who nourishes me <br>I shall beseech you only <br>Let the evil one not come <br>aside my bed as I sleep</p>
    <p>So that I could live with strength<br> You lived as a burnt off’ring <br>May you rebuke the devil <br>Who desires to destroy me</p>
    <p>O Lord, may you bring to pass<br> Your promise inside of me<br> By your death upon the cross <br>May you protect my whole life</p>
    <p>During the time that I sleep <br>Let me understand your love <br>So that at my waking hour<br> I might celebrate your name</p>
    <p>I have known your holy will<br> So declare goodness for me<br> That I might follow it well <br>By your kindness and mercy</p>
    <p>O our Savior Messiah!<br>Lord, declare for your servants<br> That they might sleep righteously <br>And enter the peaceful end</p>
    <p>For you are the Light of lights<br> And your dwelling is the Light<br> All the children of the Light<br> Worship and bow down to you</p>
    <p>Praise to you, may your mercies <br>Rest upon all your servants <br>May it be so in this world <br>And in the coming world too</p>
    <p>O my Lord, praise be to you <br>Praise be to you, praise to you<br> Thousands upon thousands more <br>Innum’rable praises be</p>
    <p>O Hearer of our prayers <br>O Granter of petitions <br>Having listened to our pray’r<br> May you grant our petitions</p>

    <p>
        Lord of heaven and angels<br>
        who is glorified by them<br>
        Worship and praise be to you<br>
        may you recieve our prayer
    </p>
    <p>
        One in Three and Three in One<br>
        Blessed is the One True God<br>
        The Father, Son and Spirit<br>
        Praise be to you forever
    </p>
    <p>
        Praise be to thee who receives<br>
        Like the firstfruit offerings<br>
        The petitions of mortals<br>
        and tears of the penitent
    </p>
    <p>
        O Lord who is exalted<br>
        By the angels in heaven<br>
        Let praise be innum'rable<br>
        By the mortals on the earth
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us life our minds above<br>
        to the triune Holy God<br>
        Father, Son, Holy Spirit<br>
        and praise Him with thanksgiving
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not seek silver and gold<br>
        which contain mortal poison<br>
        Rather seek eternal life<br>
        and hearken to true teaching
    </p>
    <p>Keep the fast for forty days<br>
    Give your bread to the hungry<br>
    Praying seven times a day<br>
    As the son of Jesse did</p>
    <p>
        Moses and Elijah both<br>
        kept a fast for forty days<br>
        Our lord also kept a fast<br>
        And bested the Accuser
    </p>
    <p>
        May the pray'rs that delivered<br>
        From the sea, pit and furnace<br>
        Open the door of mercy<br>
        for our prayer and worship
    </p>
