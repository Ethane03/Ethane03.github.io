<p>P: Have mercy on me, O God, in Your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sins.</p>
<p>C: Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
<p>P: For I acknowledge my fault, and my sin is before me always.</p>
<p>C: Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that You may be justified in Your words, and vindicated in your judgement.</p>
<p>P: For I was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>
<p>C: But You take pleasure in truth and You have made known to me the secrets of your wisdom.</p>
<p>P: Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>

<p><strong>Moudyanusa</strong></p>
<p>(prayers of repentance)</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>O omnipotent and merciful God, at this time we confess our sins and iniquities, for we take refuge in your promise that you will accept all those who are truly repentant. May you incline your holy ear and hear our prayer. O God, we have sinned against you and disobeyed all your commandments. We have erred intentionally and unintentionally, knowingly and unknowingly, in thought, word, and deed. Rather than doing that which is pleasing to your holy will, we have done abominable and hateful things in your presence, and become vessels for your wrath and punishment. Because of this, we have brought insult and offense to your name, and destruction to those around us. O God, merciful and lover of mankind, O Lord, who does not delight in the death of sinners, have mercy on us great sinners, forgive us of our every sin, and comfort us. O holy and righteous God, cleanse us from all stains and impurities. May you make us worthy to live our whole lives faultlessly and to shine as lights in the world, to join our Lord Jesus Messiah in his coming with unashamed faces, and to experience the eternal joy of your glorious kingdom.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>O God the Father, font of all mercy, perfect in love, we confess now our many sins. Our sins have degraded us. We have become the reason for the loss and sadness of other people. We have brought insult and inadequacy to the glory of God, and grief to His Fatherly love. We sorrowfully confess our sins both mental and physical, and our faults both public and private. O heavenly Father, forgive us of these all. O loving Jesus, remove the burden of our sin. O purifying holy Spirit, purify us. O triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, fulfill in us our inheritance as your children. May our prayer be heard in the name of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>O omnipotent God, O creator who blew into us the breath of life, O dear Lord who nourishes in us holy thoughts and desires, we beseech you. May you forgive us of our many sins. We have grieved you by not doing what we ought to do and by doing what we not ought to do. Have mercy on us. Purify our thoughts, desires, and deeds. Enlighten our hearts, and make us capable of seeing and grasping the apparent and eternal realities. Give us certainty that the sins which we have rejected and confessed shall no longer rule over us. May we experience the blessings of those whose disobedience has been forgiven and whose sins have been wiped away, and may we be made worthy of the eternal joy of salvation with alongside all the saints. We beseech you because of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>O omnipotent and eternal God the Father, you alone are the light to those in darkness, the strength for the weak, and the shield for the fallen. We praise You for this opportunity to confess and abandon our abundant and abject sins. We call upon your holy mercifulness, in the confidence that you accept all who come to you with a repentant heart. May you make us worthy because of the Messiah to bear praise and glory to you in the firm faith that you shall remit our sins.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>O Father, omnipotent and great in mercy, we have scattered from your path like the lost sheep. We have entirely followed the desires and thoughts of our hearts. We have disobeyed your holy commandments. We do not do what we ought to do and we do what we not ought to do. Even so, O Lord, have mercy on us miserable and guilty sinners. O God, you have mercy on those who confess their wrongs. In accordance with the promise that you made known to mankind by our Lord Jesus the Messiah, take back us penitents. O merciful Father, give us grace on account of the Messiah to walk with a good conscience, with godly devotion, and with righteousness, for the glory of your holy name.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p><strong>Petition of Mar Balai</strong></p>
<p>P: O God, who is merciful to sinners, have mercy in your righteous judgment. Forgive our guilt because of your overflowing love of your servants. O merciful one, we knock at your door, groaning in pain. Grant our petitions with your blessing. Because you bless the guilty if they return to you in sorrowful prayer, O merciful Jesus the Messiah, open to us the door of your blessing. O Heavenly Father, we pray to you. Accept our service and bless us. Praise be to him who declared: call and I will answer, knock and I will open, ask and I will give!</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>P: O great Lord, without beginning or end, who fulfills truth and promise for those who love Him, who made salvation from sin by your son Jesus the Messiah, life of all, protection of those who take refuge in you, aid to those who seek you, who strengthened us at the third hour by the appearance of tongues of fire by the Holy Spirit, may you give us this Holy gift at all times and make us glorious in it. By him, may we be purified from all public and private sin, and from all thoughts that are hateful to you. May you make us worthy to praise you for all of your graces for us, and to live in your presence with a pure heart and high mind.</p>
<p>C: Amen</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>P: O our Lord Jesus the Messiah, give to us the Holy Spirit as you gave to the Holy Apostles in the room where mysteries were revealed. Grant us the Spirit of sonship that holds authority over all things, the spirit of knowledge and power, so that he may dwell with us always and his works may never cease in us. O God the Holy Spirit, who is the King of Heaven, who gives comfort to the pure in spirit, omnipresent, who completes everything, who is the storehouse of goodness and the giver of life, turn to us and dwell among us. Purify us from all impurity, and rescue our souls. O our lord Jesus Messiah, just as you entered into the midst of your disciples and gave them peace, be with us your servants and give us peace forever. O God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you are worthy of praise and honor and glory.</p>
<p>C: Amen</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>P: O Lord, purifier of every heart, holy one, who gives favor to the pure, forgiver of sins, you know that we are unworthy to stand in your presence, and that we have no courage to come to you and open our mouths in the great presence of your Lordship. Thus, make us worthy with your abundant mercy to worship you according to your holy will. Because you are a God who loves the humble, forgive our sins, and make us worthy to find grace and blessings at this time. Let us be strengthened by your Holy Spirit, and send to us his power from the heights of your holiness as you sent it to the Holy Apostles, so that we may be pleasing to you. O Lord, turn to us, bless us, and protect us. Because you are virtue of our souls, the refuge of our hope, the light of our eyes, and the lord of our lives, grant us blameless lives. Purify our bodies and souls by the grace of your Holy Spirit, so that we may be as one body, and obtain our portion with the saints who pleased you. O God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, you are ever worthy of praise and worship and glory.</p>
<p>C: Amen.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>P: O Lord, we praise you because you have made us worthy of the Holy Spirit that you have poured out over your disciples who obeyed your commands and waited together to receive power from above. We confess that even though we receive your gifts of grace, we cast them aside and behave as sinners.</p>
<p>Renew the power of the Holy Spirit within us. O Lord, make us people of love. May we rejoice in ourselves and make others rejoice. Let us experience peace. Give kindness and forgiveness to us. Make us faithful to you, to others, and to ourselves. Let us grow in diligent charity. Adorn us with the eternal decoration of tranquility. Give us self-control. Declare grace to us that we may display the fruits of the spirit, be wise in all things, and experience peace and happiness.</p>
<p>C: Amen</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>P: O Lord, who declared that the Holy Spirit would come and convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment, let this same Holy Spirit dwell among us always. Truly convict us of the terrible fruits of sin – its abomination and ungratefulness. Convict us of the terrible judgment that we have brought upon ourselves and upon our people because of our unrighteous works, and our personal and societal lawlessness. May the Holy Spirit dwell among us, remove us from error, comfort us in hardship, and rule according to your will. May your Holy Spirit lead us along paths of truth and righteousness, and let us live a life pleasing to you in this world and experience the joy of salvation prepared for your children in the world above.</p>

<p>P: O God, the creator and protector of all, perfect in power and glory, by your love and by your own will you came for our salvation and for persecution and death on the cross, and you bore insult, humiliation, and rebuke from the Jews. You, who are the judgment of the judges, were judged by the ruler Pilate. You who are proclaimed with fear and trembling by the Cherubim on high, were scorned and hung on the cross. When you were nakedly crucified, you darkened the sun. By your great cry, you tore the curtain in the temple, you shook the earth, and you split stones. By your entrance into hell, you defeated death and Satan. You won life and hope for the dead. You gave new life to all creation by your resurrection. O Lord of Blessings, we pray with your grace on this day of your saving and life-giving resurrection. May you make us immortal and unfading, and free us from all scornful and wretched emotions. By your power, make us able to be your greatest witnesses. Make us all worthy to join you with joy in your second coming. We offer up praise and worship to you, the Father, and the Holy Spirit.
