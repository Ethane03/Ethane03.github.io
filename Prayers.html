    <p>O God who accepted the lamb of Abel,<br>
        The off’ring of Noah, and that of Abraham<br>
        May you accept our prayer<br>
        And grant us our pleading</p></div></div>

    <p>Accept prayer like the incense that Aaron sent up<br>
    Receive service like the cry of the Ninevites<br>
    As you spoke unto Jonah<br>
    answer unto your servants</p></div></div>

    <p>Glory be to God Jesus for his grace and mercy.<br>

    When the Ninevites called on you,<br>
    You delivered them from wrath</p></div></div>
<div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text">
    <p>O God enthroned in the heights by the praise of your servants<br>
    You came down and dwelt in the lap of blessed Mary<br>
    May your peace and comfort dwell<br>
    In all four corners of the world<br>
</p></div></div>

    May Your Light reveal the sin in our hearts.<br>
    As we humbly pray, in spirit and truth.</p></div></div>

    That our prayers may rise up to You.</p></div></div>
