          Make us worthy, O Lord God, 
          to glorify you like the flaming messenger of God who made your advent known to the Daughter of David,
          to magnify you like that holy virgin,
          to take refuge in you like that righteous man who grasped the mystery of your conception,
          to sing a marvellous hallelujah to you,
          and to glorify you, your father, and the Holy Spirit with holiness.

            O God the Word, who by the will of the Holy Spirit of your Father commanded the angel Gabriel
            to announce to the holy virgin Mary concerning your marvellous and wonderful conception,
            we offer up praise and glory to you. He descended from the heights and dwelt in the holy womb,
            without change from his former place he became flesh by his birth from the holy virgin,
            without injury to her virginity. Therefore, with praises and hallelujahs do we celebrate this
            day of the annunciation to the holy virgin. May we be made worthy of the pardon of sins, O merciful Lord, 
            and may we be removed from all punishments, rods of wrath, and eternal torture.
            O Lord, may we be made worthy to bear praise, honor, glory, worship unto You, your Father,
            and the Holy Spirit, for the sake of your every grace, at this time, on all festivals, seasons, and times,
            and all the days of our lives. Hasha...

          O God, the Most High, Unimaginable, who dwells in the unnaproachable light,
          Merciful, Gracious, who brought all creation into existence by your indescribable love and undiminishable blessings
          which have neither beginning nor end, you sent Gabriel the Seraph, the Watcher, your servant and your ambassador, and the head of the angels,
          to Your stainless and unmarried Mother to announce your glorious and miraculous conception, because you desired
          to forgive criminals, to free our frail race from slavery to the accuser and lead us to the path of perfection and to a new nature.
          By the intercession of your ambassador, and by the peace granted to your Mother who is more pure than all humans,
          you washed your mother clean and dwelt in her as a clean palace. You were born of her and became the second Adam.
          Because You who births families and tribes was revealed from the race of women, you brought glory and honor to all virgins.
          Therfore we magnify you, who was born of the all-beautiful virgin. 
          Praise be to you, joy of the whole world!
          Praise be to you, Word of the Father! Praise be to you, Genesis of every goodness that brings joy and life to the word!
          Praise be to you, Armor of the race of all men who have been defeated by the encampment and army of the Accuser.
          Praise be to you, Harbor and Refuge of all mankind!
          Praise be to you, Spring of the water of life and Stream of all blessings!
          Praise be to you, Light to all who dwell in darkness!
          Praise be to you, Truth of the angels, Pride of the Prophets, Happiness of the Apostles, and Joy of the Martyrs!
          Our Lord Messiah, may you comfort us from grief, rescue us from all hardship,  remove us from persecution,
          strengthen our weaknesses, encourage the weak of heart, make sinners righteous, and reinforce us of little faith.
          May we be made worthy to observe the day of your appearance and be found worthy of the high calling,
          and to bear praise and glory to you, your Father and the Holy Spirit. Hasha...

            O Most High, who descended from the nearness of your most glorious Father,
            who dwelt in the womb of the holy virgin Mary
            and took flesh of her by your holy will,
            and saved our race from the bondage of sin,
            may you accept from us this incense of spices that we offer to you
            on this day of the glorious annunciation.
            O God the glorious and only Son, who came for our salvation,
            Grant pardon of sins to your people who have been saved
            by your incarnation and your priceless cross,
            and who have gathered in your presence. Hasha...
