          to magnify you like that holy virgin,
          to take refuge in you like that righteous man who grasped the mystery of your conception,
          to sing a marvellous hallelujah to you,
          and to glorify you, your father, and the Holy Spirit with holiness.

            O God the Word, who by the will of the Holy Spirit of your Father commanded the angel Gabriel
            to announce to the holy virgin Mary concerning your marvellous and wonderful conception,
            we offer up praise and glory to you. He descended from the heights and dwelt in the holy womb,
            without change from his former place he became flesh by his birth from the holy virgin,
            without injury to her virginity. Therefore, with praises and hallelujahs do we celebrate this
            day of the annunciation to the holy virgin. May we be made worthy of the pardon of sins, O merciful Lord, 
            and may we be removed from all punishments, rods of wrath, and eternal torture.
            O Lord, may we be made worthy to bear praise, honor, glory, worship unto You, your Father,
            and the Holy Spirit, for the sake of your every grace, at this time, on all festivals, seasons, and times,
            and all the days of our lives. Hasha...

          O God, the Most High, Unimaginable, who dwells in the light which no one is able to approach
          Merciful, Gracious, who brought all creation into existence by your indescribable love and undiminishable blessings
          which have neither beginning nor end, you sent Gabriel the Seraph, the Watcher, your servant and your ambassador, the head of the angels,
          to Your stainless and unmarried Mother to announce your glorious and miraculous conception, because you willed that
          to forgive criminals, to free our frail race from slavery to the accuser and lead us to the path of perfection toward a new nature.
          By the intercession of your ambassador, and by the peace granted to your Mother who is more pure than all humans,
          you washed your mother clean and dwelt in her as a clean palace. You were born of her and became the second Adam.
          Because You who births families and tribes was revealed from the race of women, you brought glory and honor to all virgins.
          Therfore, we magnify you, who was born of the virgin full of every beauty. Praise be to you, joy of the whole world!
          Praise be to you, Word of the Father! Praise be to you, Genesis of every goodness that brings joy and life to the word.
