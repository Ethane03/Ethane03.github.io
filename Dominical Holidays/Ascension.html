          O Lord God, make us worthy to celebrate this great and
          glorious festival of Your amazing ascension with divine
          praises, pure voices, glorious hymns and the melodious
          songs of the Holy Spirit. On the wondrous day of Your
          appearance, make us worthy to join the angels in heaven to
          celebrate the festival with them, and praise and adore Your
          glorious and holy name, and that of Your Father and the Holy
          Spirit.

        <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>He who is begotten of the Father before all worlds, ascended today to heaven in Glory.
          He who was with the Father, goes to His right hand today in body. He who rose to the heights from below, raised the lowly race of men up to the heights with him.
          He who descended and touched the depths, ascended to the heights above. Today our Lord went up to Bethany with his disciples, ascended the mount called Bethsaita, 
          blessed them, placing his holy hands on their heads, and ascended to his Fathers side in glory. The dsiciples saw this and stood amazed, and glorified the ascension of their Lord and King.
          Today was fulfilled the word foretold by David, the son of Jesse, through the Holy Spirit, 'God ascended with glory and the trumpet's sound'. Angels clothed in silver came down and said 
          'O Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking at the sky?'

            You are the One true God, and You are eternally One in
            essence, united in will, equal in power and authority,
            uncreated, without beginning or end, and self-existent. You
            are the unchanging Light and the everlasting Power whose
            strength is infinite. You are the Sun that never fades, and
            whose beauty radiates forever. You are holy, and all holiness
            belongs to You. You are worshipped, praised and glorified
            and are worthy of tribute, honour and adoration on this day
            when we celebrate the day of Your ascension, at all feasts
            and seasons, and all the days of our lives, forever more.

          <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>
            O Lord our Messiah, the Most High and the Almighty, You
            are glorious, blessed, wondrously great and beyond
            description. You are carried on the clouds, seated on the
            wings of the wind, celebrated by the cherubim in accordance
            with the Spirit, and receives perfect praises from the
            seraphim. You are the Lord God and Saviour of all.
            After Your resurrection from the tomb, You displayed Your
            divinity to Your chosen, holy disciples. You told them,
            “Unless I go away, the Holy Spirit will not come to You”. After
            You assured them in this way, You told them, “You must
            have divine love; love one another with God’s love.” On the
            holy day of Your ascension, You went with them to the Mount
            of Olives. As You reached and were about to ascend to
            heaven, Your disciples were in deep sorrow. You then
            commanded them, “Till I send You what my Father has
            promised, remain in Jerusalem.”
            When You ascended to heaven in great glory, the angels
            and archangels proclaimed victoriously and declared aloud
            with glorious voices, “Praise to the King of Glory, who
            descended and saved Adam and his descendants from the
            way of error and sin. Lift up your heads you gates, so that
            the King of Glory may enter; be lifted up, you ancient doors,
            blessed is the King of Glory who became the sacrifice on
            Golgotha. Blessed be the King whose side was pierced open
            with a spear, who redeemed us through His precious blood
            and sprinkled life on Adam’s mortal race. Blessed is the King
            of Glory who preached the gospel to all nations.”
            O Lord of all kingdoms, Your status and honour are blessed.
            Your coming down to earth for us without surrendering Your
            exalted and divine throne is blessed. Your grace which moved You to descend onto the household of the children of
            Adam to liberate them from the way of error, is blessed.
            O eternal King of kings, Your kingdom is blessed. O Jesus
            who is the Saviour of all, Your graciousness is also blessed.
            O Lord, on this day of the Feast of Ascension, we beseech
            You to glorify Your holy Church with divine majesty, and
            bless her through the hymns of the Holy Spirit. We pray that
            in Your mercy, You will fill her treasury with the wealth of
            Your good gifts, save her from dissensions, quarrels,
            punishments and harm, and eliminate evil from Your Church.
            Keep her firmly rooted on Your promises and adorn her
            progeny with Your support, mercy and compassion. Broaden
            her boundaries in all nations and guard her as she expands
            to all corners of the earth, so that, for as long as the world
            exists, she can glorify You on this day of the Feast of Your
            Ascension. Enable Your salvation to spread among her offspring and protect them from the evil one. In Your grace and
            through Your manifold blessings, lavishly grant them divine
            and virtuous gifts. We will offer praise and thanksgiving to
            You, Your Father and the Holy Spirit, now and forever more.

            Praise be to You O God the Word, who came down from
            heaven for our sake, took flesh from the holy virgin, suffered
            and died for us, rose from the tomb on the third day to accept
            us into heaven, and victoriously ascended into heaven on
            this day. O Lord, on this glorious day of the Feast of Your
            Feast of our Lord’s Ascension 165
            Ascension into heaven, may the prayers that we offer in Your
            holy presence rise up to You. As we delight in the allure of
            Your sweet perfume, and adorn ourselves with Your virtuous
            spiritual gifts, enable us to be always eager for the indwelling
            of the Holy Spirit that You promised to send to Your holy
            disciples, so that we may be worthy to offer praise, honour
            and worship to You, Your Father and the Holy Spirit, now
            and forever more.
