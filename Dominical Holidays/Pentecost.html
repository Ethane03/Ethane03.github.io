          O Lord our God who neither slumbers nor sleeps, wake us
          from our deep and sinful slumber, so that we may praise
          Your watchfulness over us. Immortal and living God, arouse

          adore Your mercy. O God: the Father, the Son and the Holy
          Spirit, because You alone are praised and glorified in heaven

            O great God who has no beginning or end, and who keeps
            Your promises true to those who love You, through Your Son
            Jesus Christ, You accomplished the redemption for sin. You
            are the Sustainer of life for all, the Refuge to all who put their
            trust in You and the Helper to those who seek You. O Lord,
            who sent the Holy Spirit to the disciples as tongues of fire at
            the third hour to empower them, fill us always with this divine
            gift, and enrich us through it. Deliver us from all our private
            and overt sins, and cleanse all our thoughts that are
            displeasing to You. Make us worthy to thank You for all Your
            graciousness towards us and to live in Your presence with a
            pure heart and a virtuous mind.

            Praise be to You, O invisible and self-existent One who is
            obscure and unfathomable to all human thoughts and
            emotions, and the perfection of power, love and goodness.
            You are the One who created everything that is visible and
            invisible, and maintains order. You have no beginning or end,
            You are eternal and the One for whom no boundary can be
            set. You are the One true God: the Father, the Son and the
            Holy Spirit; One in essence, One in authority and with One
            will. There is no name other than that of ‘Three Persons’ and
            no distinction between them. If you say ‘Father’, then the Son
            and the Spirit are included. If you say ‘Son’, then the Father
            and the Spirit are also known through Him. If you say ‘Spirit’,
            then the Father and the Son make Him complete. The Father
            is the Creator. The Son is begotten of Him. The Holy Spirit
            proceeds from the Father, is drawn from the Son and is equal
            with the Father in essence. We ascribe praise and
            thanksgiving to the perfect Triune God; God the Father who
            is the first in the Trinity, the Son and the Holy Spirit, at this
            time of the commemoration of Pentecost and all the days of
            our lives, forever more.

            O One true God who is invisible, beyond scrutiny,
            immeasurable and eternal, You created mankind in Your
            likeness. When they exercised their own free will and went
            astray to worship the devil, You chose to restore them
            according to Your holy will and sent Your Son, the Word.
            Without change to His divine nature, He became man. He
            enabled us to truly grasp the aspects of Your divinity that
            were beyond our understanding, and interpreted it clearly to
us. He taught us about You, about Himself who came from
You and revealed the inexplicable divine mystery, that the
Holy Spirit who is the third Light in the Godhead, also
proceeded from You. The Holy Spirit is the true Spirit and the
Comforter, and is noble, virtuous, wise and valiant. The Holy
Spirit creates perfection, is all-sufficient, immeasurable,
limitless and loves humanity. The Holy Spirit inspired the
prophets, and instilled wisdom in the apostles. The Holy
Spirit crowns the clerics, grants understanding to teachers of
the Word, establishes Churches, perfects divine worship and
extols the priesthood. The Holy Spirit holds many varied gifts
for His ministry, is the source of all virtue and the treasury of
goodness. He speaks clearly of things that are obscure,
predicts the future and works miracles. The Holy Spirit
convicts us of sin, brings about repentance and confirms
believers. In essence, He is equal to You and to Your only
Son. On the heavenly throne of Your kingdom, He is
appropriately seated with You and has spoken through the
law, the prophets and the apostles. He stays alongside
everything and makes everything perfect.
O Lord our God, on this great Feast of Pentecost, Your
servants worship You, and pray that You pour on us the gift
of the Holy Spirit. Fill us with Your divine wisdom as You did
in the holy apostles, so that we may understand the mystery
of Your divine teachings. Cleanse us from all the blemishes
of sin, and enable us to be adorned like sanctified temples to
become the abode for Your indwelling. Graciously bestow
the Holy Spirit in each one of us. Protect us through His
divine ministry, so that we will not succumb to temptations or
be harmed by it. Fill us with the Spirit’s fruit of love, joy and
peace, through the grace of the Holy Spirit. Enable us to
serve You with pure hearts and honour Your
commandments. Bestow on us true love and divine power,
by unfurling the rays of the Holy Spirit, and save us from the
darkness of sin. As we Your servants assemble here to
worship You, strengthen and help us to live for You and to
complete our lives in You. O God the Father, who is Three in
One, we ascribe praise and thanksgiving to You, to Your only
Son and to the Holy Spirit who fulfils everything, is blessed,
gives life, is equal with You in essence and rules over us,
now and forever more.

          <h3>Supplication</h3>
          <p>O Lord our Messiah who is blessed by the heavenly hosts,
            sanctified with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and is the
            radiant ray of genuine light, You chose to come down to us
            according to Your holy will and to blend Your likeness with
            us. You were born in the flesh through the Virgin Mary, to
            accomplish our salvation through the fulfilment of Your
            nativity, baptism, passion, death and resurrection. After
            accomplishing Your salvific deeds and before Your
            Feast of the Day of Pentecost 200
            ascension into heaven, You told Your disciples that unless
            You leave, another Counsellor will not come to them. You
            then ascended into heaven after You instructed them to
            remain in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit was sent to them
            from the Father. According to Your promise, on the Day of
            Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came suddenly and rested on
            each of them, granted them divine gifts, adorned them with
            divine wisdom, enlightened their minds with the counsel of
            the Holy Spirit, and blessed them with the gift of speaking in
            many tongues. O Lord, today as we celebrate this day of
            remembrance at the Feast of Pentecost, we appeal to Your
            inexpressible love for humanity, and pray that You shower
            us with the grace of the divine and life-giving Holy Spirit.
            Make us worthy to be cleansed from all the defilement of sin
            Produce in us the virtuous fruits of faith, hope and love. Grant
            reconciliation, peace and unity to Your holy Church.
            Remember the sick and the distressed, the orphans and
            widows. We ascribe praise and thanksgiving to You, to Your
            Father and to the Holy Spirit, now and forever more. Amen</p>
