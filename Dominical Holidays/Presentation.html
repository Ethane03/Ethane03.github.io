          One True God from the beginning, glorified above all things,
          who is far from the thoughts and considerations of men,
          who is unseen and hidden,
          who cannot be examined, nor explained, nor imagined by men,

          Mighty, all-valiant, eternal King, who is without beginning or end in nature, and equal to the Father and Holy Spirit in existence, 
          Thou art indescribable. The borders of the expanse of your works are unable to be marked. The great works of your love for mankind cannot be imagined.
          From the beginning, by the action of your holy will, and your command which has the power of creation, 
          you created the ranks of <em>Hailavase</em>, and the hosts of angels and archangels for your glory. 
          And in addition to these You brought into existence the sun and moon and stars to be a light and ornament to all.
          When the appointed time came, you became man from a woman and put on the form of a servant, without sin, and fulfilled all these things.
          You should us glorious deeds and miracles. You fulfilled all the prophecies uttered by the holy prophets who foretold you.
          You fulfilled the sacred entrance into the house of God, in accordance with the law. The elderly Simeon, who had been commanded to wait to see this matter, 
          recieved the power of understanding by the Holy Spirit, came running with joy and in his hands weakened by age he took You and held you, confessing 
          'You are the light of the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel'. When you became the acceptor of sacrifices and the perfector of sacraments, 
          you made an offering for yourself, in accordance with the law and for your purification, though you are Holy and purer than all. Thereby you revealed
          that you are the Lord of the Old and the New Covenents. As the aged Simeon besought you, 'Lord now let your servant depart. For my eyes have see your salvation',
          we also beseech and pray to your mercy. Make us worthy, O Lord, to accept you in the hidden rooms of our souls. May we adore (വാത്സല്ലിക്കുക) you with our bodies' visible hands.
          May the holy movement of our lips adore (താലോലിക്കുക) you. May we endlessly carry out your salvific holy days in a Divine and Christian manner.
          On this holy day that you specially entered into the House of God, and thereby freed those in chains and bondage, gathered the scattered, brought back those who had gone astray and missing,
          opened the eyes of the blind, enlightened the darkness, adorned the Holy Church, when the earth and all that is in it rejoiced, and the Prophetess Hannah was glad and prophecied in joy, 
          may we also celebrate with joy, and be glad with Simeon and Hannah, and may we be able to join in the unremovable and unchangeable blessing of that holy day.
          This we pray, along with all others celebrating and rejoicing on this day, and bless and glorify you, and by your your Father who sent you for our salvation, and your Holy Spirit. Hosho...
