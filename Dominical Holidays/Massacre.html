            O Lord Messiah, the Bridegroom who allowed children 
            and nursing babies to be killed by the jealous, violent, and deceitful, Herod and to become new martyrs
            on account of your bodily birth, remove from us deceit, jealousy, enmity, and evil
            and sow peace and joy among us. May we speak the truth and be far from all distress.

            At the determined time, you put on flesh from the holy virgin,and you rescued and freed the whole world by your
            incarnation from her. Because of your bodily birth pure and sacred infants were plucked from their mothers' arms by the evil Herod 
            without mercy and were slain by the sword, and by their murder were made inheritors of the heavenly kingdom, and 
            friends of their Lord the bridegroom. O only son of the Father, who enacted all these things,
            Light of existence and most high, worthy are you of praise and honor and worship at this time, on all feast days, seasons, and times, and all the days of our lives.

            O Lord Messiah, the Spring of life, the Stream of blessings, the Origin of goodness,
            the Fountain of joy, and the Wisdom and Power of God the Father, who opened to us the door and way to heaven by your coming to the world, 
            and who prepared a ladder for us, when you you inhabited space (borders and parts),
            you were adored on the holy knees of your mother, and you were seen by children and infants.
            You made them to be spotless companions before you, you fixed them as good stones on the crown of the holy church,
            and you counted the children of men among the ranks of angels to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven in place of
            those who had fallen from it. This action was foretold and made known by the preaching of the holy prophets who foresaw the things to come;
            By the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah that comfort has departed from Rachel for the sake of the slain children, 
            concerning the murder of the children who are vessels of love,
            and concerning groans and weeping of the mothers of those blessed ones.
            You gathered the women greiving over the misery, that they would sing 
            cries of grief over the slaughter of their children who had been robbed from them by Herod's plot.
            Their mothers' hands were soaked in the blood of their necks; Breastmilk and blood ran together from their necks.
            They were plucked from the laps of their mothers and a cry of grief arose that everyone there could hear.
            As a dove for her children, in misery their mothers wailed and cried over them with cries and groaning. 
            This mournful voice echoed through all of Ramah. Everwhere were heard weeping and comfortless cries.
            The infants were concealed from the sword, they were hidden away in their mothers's laps.
            But they were stolen by tormentors from their mothers's loins and killed without mercy.
            They departed from this life, and they were crowned in life eternal.
            In place of the blood that covered them, they were clothed in robes of light. 
            In place of their departure from their mothers' laps, they were sent to the kingdom of Heaven.
            Because they were denied the love of their mothers and fathers, they became spiritual siblings in the Lord Messiah.
            Because they were prohibited from enjoying the sweetness of this world, they rejoiced in blessings indescribable. 
            Because their pure bodies were buried together,
