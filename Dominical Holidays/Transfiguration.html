          O Lord God, of Your own will, You revealed Your glory on
          Mount Tabor, affirmed the faith of Your beloved disciples and
          showed them the great mystery of Your divinity. Instil in us,
          an unwavering and true faith in You, and make us worthy to
          praise and adore You, Your Father and the Holy Spirit.
          Elevate our thoughts and understanding, so that we may

            O Lord the eternal Light, Your brilliance was ignited on Mount
            Tabor on a day like this, and You allowed Your apostles to
            witness this glorious revelation, and gaze upon the majesty
            of Your divine and inimitable holy countenance. We praise
            You because You revealed to Your holy servants, that You
            came of Your own will to restore Adam to his original glory,
            by humbling Yourself for his sake. O incomprehensible and
            amazing One, You revealed a glimpse of Your divine
            brilliance to Your apostles, and removed the darkness of
            ignorance from their eyes. We praise, honour and worship
            You at this celebration of the feast of Your glory, and all the
            days of our lives, forever more.

          <h3>Sedra</h3>
          <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>
            O God the Word, our true Creator, because we live and walk
            in Your ways, we ponder on the mystery of Your wondrous
            salvific deeds, and continuously offer thanksgiving and
            everlasting praise to Your Lordship. O virtuous One, who is
            the source of all goodness, who can define Your power?
            O treasury of greatness, even the tongues of the wisest,
            cannot adequately praise even a small iota of Your divinity.
            O eternal essence of the eternal Father, You existed before
            the beginning of time and was begotten from the lap of the
            ineffable One. In the fullness of time, You came down of Your
            own holy will, and chose to redeem those whom You had
            created, because of Your love for humanity. You are the
            unchanging, true essence of the Father and we ascribe
            praises to You and sing praises and adoration to Your
            divinity. You took flesh of the holy Virgin Mary and performed
            signs, wonders and miracles.
            Of Your own will, You chose to reveal to Your holy apostles
            Your divine love for humanity, which was the reason for Your
            salvific passion and resurrection. Through Your divine Word
            You prophesied that, “There are some standing here who will
            not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in
            His glory.” In this way, You taught the apostles whom You
            led up the mountain, and You showed them a glimpse of the
            indescribable glory and radiance of Your divinity.
            On this day of Your glorious feast, You took Peter, James
            and John with You and led them up Mount Tabor, and You
            were transfigured before them and Your face shone like the
            sun. You made it known that at the end of ages, the righteous
            will shine like the sun and be transformed from the
            perishable into the imperishable state. On this special and
            holy day, the clothes on Your body became whiter than
            snow. On this glorious day, Your true servants, Moses from
            among the dead and Elijah from among the living, came to
            You and spoke about Your life-giving passion and Peter
            Cephas wanted to put up tents on the mountain of Your
            Lordship. On this day, the Father sent a bright cloud from on
            high, which descended on Mount Tabor and Your divinity
            was revealed to the apostles by a loud voice from on high
            which said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with Him I am well
            pleased. Listen to Him!” On this day, because of the radiance
            of Your face, the brightness of the cloud and the voice of
            Your glorious Father, the apostles were terrified and fell with
            their faces to the ground. Because of Your love for them, You
            went to them, raised them and taught them that Your death
            on the cross would be of Your own will and not due to human
            weakness. We believe that the glorious expression on Your
            face was changed and Your divinity was revealed in Your
            body.
            Turn our hearts from vice to virtue and from the darkness of
            evil deeds to virtuous endeavours that comes with true faith.
            Remove from us the filthy covering of our impure desires and
            make the garments of our deeds, brighter than sunlight.
            Make us worthy to set out to welcome You at Your second
            coming. Make us worthy to be sheltered within the tents of
            Your glorious brightness, and to hear Your inviting voice
            saying, “Come and inherit the holy and glorious kingdom of
            heaven.” We offer praise and thanksgiving to You, to Your
            Father who sent You for our salvation, and to the Holy Spirit,
            now and forever more.
