    <h1>Foreword</h1>
    <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>There is a misconception that the season of Lent is only a season of fasting. But it should be seen as a season that awakens the imagination of practices both mental and physical. As food is needed for the body, and air for life, prayer is necessary for the nourishment of the soul. The prayer lives of the church fathers make clear that the early church found power through a life of prayer, while passing through the midst of persecution. The set of prayers during Hasha week (Holy Week) and other fasts recall to us this treasure. Abraham Melpan Achan formed the daily prayer book from such a treasure chest of prayers and gave it as a gift to the spirituality of the Mar Thoma church. In earlier times, this order of worship was used for daily prayer. The treasure was distributed in prayers throughout the various hours of the day during Hasha week. Because the prayers are out of use and often overlooked in this season, is desirable to reorganize our prayer lives toward the season of Lent.</p></div></div>
    <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>This order of worship for Lent, formed from the treasure mine of the prayers of the fathers under the leadership of our Joseph Mar Barnabus Episcopa Thirumeni, will be helpful to forming an imaginative prayer live. Through its use, the treasure that the Eastern church fathers have given us in prayers and songs will be seen. I pray that the use of this order of prayer will help you move from the inclination of recent times to only see spirituality in emotion, and to grasp the value in a spiritual life through meditation and humility.</p></div></div>
    <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>I hope that the church members might use this order of prayer and discover its value. Much gratitude to everyone involved in the composition of this liturgy. This order of prayer is permitted for use in our houses and prayer groups.</p></div></div>
