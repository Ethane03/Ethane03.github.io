On that day, forgive us of all that we have done against your commands. Give unto us the Holy Spirit, let us daily die to the world, the flesh, and the devil, and be resurrected into righteousness, let us walk in newness of life, and send out the fruit of good works, and let us be made worthy of your many blessings because of your only son.</p></div></div>

    <h2>Psalm 38</h2>
    <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; do not punish me in your wrath. For your arrows have already pierced me, and your hand presses hard upon me. There is no health in my flesh, because of your indignation; there is no soundness in my body, because of my sin. For my iniquities overwhelm me; like a heavy burden they are too much for me to bear. My wounds stink and fester by reason of my foolishness. I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; I go about in mourning all the day long. My loins are filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body. I am utterly numb and crushed; I wail, because of the groaning of my heart. O Lord, you know all my desires, and my sighing is not hidden from you. My heart is pounding, my strength has failed me, and the brightness of my eyes is gone from me. My friends and companions draw back from my affliction; my neighbors stand afar off. Those who seek after my life lay snares for me; those who strive to hurt me speak of my ruin and plot treachery all the day long. But I am like the deaf who do not hear, like those who are mute and do not open their mouth. I have become like one who does not hear and from whose mouth comes no defense. For in you, O Lord, have I fixed my hope; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said, "Do not let them rejoice at my expense, those who gloat over me when my foot slips.” Truly, I am on the verge of falling, and my pain is always with me. I will confess my iniquity and be sorry for my sin. Those who are my enemies without cause are mighty, and many in number are those who wrongfully hate me. Those who repay evil for good slander me, because I follow the course that is right. O Lord, do not forsake me; be not far from me, O my God. Make haste to help me, O Lord of my salvation.</p></div></div>

O God who forgets not the cries of beggars, forget not the cry of me, a sinner. O God who gives aid to all who take refuge in you, reach out with your right hand and help me. O God, who does not reject the plea of the distressed, reject not the plea of my poverty. O God who does not send away the brokenhearted, send me not away from your presence. O God who does not abandon his own creation, do not abandon me. O God who is near to the brokenhearted, take my soul and add it into your salvation. O God who does not destroy the refuge of the lost, destroy not the refuge of my heart. O Lord, draw me close to you, let me not fall into the hands of the liar, into the hands of the enemy. Make me righteous like the tax collector, accept me like the thief, bring me into your flock. Wash me like the sinful woman. Enlighten my darkness with the light of your knowledge. Forgive me of all the sins which I have committed in your presence, knowingly and unknowingly. As you forgive me of my trespasses, give me grace to forgive those who have trespassed against me. Amen</p></div></div>
