            <p>A grapevine was taken from Egypt - with power, signs and wonders<br>
            yet she dishonored the Lord  - who planted Her in Canaan</p>
            <p>She brought forth fruit of insult - mockey and derision<br>
            Come quickly O Abraham - and see your Daughter Israel</p>
            <p>O Jacob come and weep for - the garden that bears fruit of <br>
            spite and the cross for her Lord - and her saviour, Jesus</p>
            <p>Blessed is the Lord who did - destroy the barren garden<br>
            which bore rottten fruit for Him - and planted instead the Church</p>
            <p>O King Omnipotent grant - your servants power and aid<br>
            that we might offer the fruits - of praise to you forever</p>
            <p>Praise be forever to You - who have to be sacrificed<br>
            Who redeemed the race of men - and accepts our offerings</p>
            <p>You abolished sacrifice - and fulfilled all mysteries<br>
            by being the sacrifice - that gives sanctification</p>

            <p>
                Go Sinner, to Jesus in dark Gethsemane.<br>
                See your Lord exhausted in battle with Satan,<br>
                who fires flaming arrows, as the Father places<br>
                sin's burden on His Son, become prey for the sword.<br>
                He melts in the fires of wrath; the Holy Body sweats blood<br>
                In prayer He accepts the will of His Father
            </p>
            <p>
                O Sinner, draw near to Lord Jesus crucified<br>
            Love awakens in the depths of the Heart of God<br>
            And overflowing, it pours out over your head<br>
            The Holy Face shines bright even in the darkest night<br>
            There is not day that the Love of God shall depart<br>
            from over You, nor shall the light of God grow dim<br>
            O Lord, grant me the light of your Holy Spirit<br>
            The by faith I might see clearly the Light of God
            </p>
            <p>Answer O God, Answer O God and have mercy<br>
                May you turn the minds of men toward repentance</p>
