            <p>My soul is greived unto death - stay here and keep watch with me<br>
            The sleepless One prayed at night - to remove the cup of death</p>

            Who had traveled through their land - teaching and doing good works</p>
            <p>They came and surrounded Him - as if they had caught a thief<br>
            Bearing swords and rods in hand - they came up against Jesus</p>
            <p>The accurs'd Jews stood before - the Lord and wagged their heads<br>
            They mocked Him and shouted out - "Rule us O King of the Jews"</p>
            <p>Who would not weep with Simon - who was grieved when he recalled<br>
            his oath that he broke three times - saying "I do not know Him"</p>
            <p>As a criminal did Christ - stand before the tribunal<br>
            to free the servants of sin - he was beat by His servants</p>

            <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>Prophecies and Types were fulfilled in a holy body by the Word, begotten of the Father before the ages, who put on flesh from the Virgin Mary in the fulness of time. The Mystery hidden for generations was revealed in the midst of the earth. The One praised in awe among the heavenly ranks was abused by wretched men. Though the heavens are not enough to describe His glory, they spat on His face and beat Him with a whip. The Judge of judges was put to trial today. The One who spread the heavens like a garment and established the earth over the waters, was judged guilty by the judge Pilate. <br><br>
                The Watchers above see him and tremble, yet the mortals below mock Him. The Cherubim in the heights bless Him, yet the wicked on earth below insult Him. The Seraphim in the heights describe His holiness, yet deceivers on earth below abuse Him. The One who is clothed with light in the heavens,
                was clothed with humiliation by those on earth. The One who is praised with the Father in the heavens, was counted with the criminals on earth. The One, who from the heavens, crowns all kings, was crowned on earth with thorns. The One, who in the heavens, shares heavenly glory with the Father and the Holy Spirit, was crucified between thieves on earth.
                The One who, from the heavens, turned bitter water into a sweet drink at Marah, was offered in return, a bitter drink on earth. The One who, in the heavens, breathed the breath of life into Adam, offered up His life on earth for Adam's race.Therefore O Lord, we pray to You
                with grateful hearts. We praise You because You bore suffering in your body for us. We praise You because, by Your death, You gave us life. We praise You because by Your glorious resurrection, You have raised us up into the presence of the Father. We affirm Your humanity and praise Your divinity. You are worthy of praise and honor and worship <em>hosho vab’kula suban l’olmeen</em></p></div></div>

            O Lord, absolve your servants<br>
            of the evil we have done!</p>
            <p>You healed the blind and the deaf<br>
            and gave voices to the mute<br>
            You purified the lepers<br>
            And cast demons out of men<br>
            You calmed the wrath of the sea<br>
            and the anger of the wind</p>
            <p>You considered not these pow'rs<br>
            In ultimate sacrifice<br>
            May you form your reflection<br>
            In us by the holy Spir't</p>
            <p>O hearer of our prayers<br>
                O granter of petitions<br>
                May you hear our prayers and<br>
                May you grant our petitions</p>

            <p>O Lord our Messiah, <br>
                who forgave Simon even though he denied Thee, <br>
                have mercy on us, who take refuge in Thee.</p>
            <p>Praise be to thee, O Lord...</p>
