<p>You who by your dawning gave light to the whole world<br>
Enlighten now my heart and soul by a bright dawn<br>
O Light of the Father who dwelt in Mary's womb<br>
Let light now dwell within me and forgive my sins!</p>

    O Strong Warrior who has broken the yoke of Death<br>
    Break the yoke that Satan has locked around my neck<br>

    Fulfill my thirst and my hunger at your table

</p>
<p>
    I am a man who was born in iniquity<br>
    and I ever dwell among a wicked people<br>
    He places a coal on my lips from the altar<br>
    and says to me, all your sins are now forgiven
</p>
<p>
    Whom do the Seraphim tremble to look upon?<br>
    We now see him as bread and wine on the altar<br>
    If those clothed in lightning saw him, they would be burned<br>
    Yet we mortals consume him with faces unveiled
</p>

    Here stands the priest like a man dressed in robes of silk<br>
    and distributes precious rubies to the faithful<br>

    Lord who rode a donkey through the streets of Zion<br>
    Grant us grace to lay down our cloaks at your coming
