<h2>First Lesson</h2>
<h2>Second Lesson</h2>
<p>In Your Light, we see the light, Jesus, full of light.<br>
    It’s Your Light that shines upon our world,
    light our minds.<br>
    May Your Light reveal the sin in our hearts.<br>
    As we humbly pray, in spirit and truth
    </p>
<p>
    Pure and holy One, who dwells on high, 
in mansions of light.<br>
Cleanse our hearts and souls; 
we lift them up, unto You.<br>
Grant us purity of thought and mind,<br>
That our prayers may rise up to You.
