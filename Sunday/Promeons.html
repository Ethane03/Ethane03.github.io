        <h1>Promeon and Sedra, to be recited after the main Promeon and Sedra of the Qurbana</h1>
        <h3>Promeon</h3>
        <p>Praiseworthy is the sweet fruit, and blessed is the beautiful offering who was offered up for us,
             who gave us the remission of sins, and who cleansed us by his purifying sacrifice.
            The Lord Messiah, the lamb, the Son of the virgin ewe, ascended the cross and delivered us and saved us from the sacrifices of dumb animals.
            To him belongs praise and honor and glory, at this time of the divine sacrifice of worship, on all holy days, 
            at all times and hours, and all the days of our lives.</p>
        <h3>Sedra</h3>
        <p>O Lord God, the omnipotent, who accepts this sacrifice of praise from those who are calling on you with all their hearts. 
            Accept this incense from us, your sinful servants. Bring us closer to your holy altar. Give us strength to offer unto you
             spiritual sacrifices and offerings for our sins and for the crimes of your people. Let us act as acceptable sacrifices to you.
              Let the High Holy Spirit dwell on us, on this offered Qurbana, and on your faithful people, because of our Lord Jesus Messiah.
               The power and glory are his, yours, and your Holy Spiritâ€™s, now and forever.</p>
        <h3>Promeon</h3>
        <p>To the Lord Messiah, who offered himself as a sacrifice for our deliverance, who broke his body and fed us,
             who opened his side and gave us drink, and raised us with him into heaven, belongs praise and honor and glory,
             at this time of the divine sacrifice of worship, on all holy days, in all times, and hours, and all the days of our lives.</p>
        <h3>Sedra</h3>
        <p>O God of gods, Lord of lords, Judge of judges, terrible unto the authorities, In whose presence the 
            burning ones tremble, and in whose sight the spirits shake, we worship in your presence, 
        and we pray to your divinity. You have made us worthy to serve you like the holy seraphim, 
    and you have communed with us in the venerable mysteries of your divinity. (O Lord), absolve us by your multitude of mercies,
    to stand in holiness in your presence and before your holy altar, and serve you in purity aat your holy table.
    May you sanctify this bread and wine placed before us. Cleanse our bodies and souls. Wipe us from all the mud of sin.
    May we offer pleasant and spotless sacrifices to you, and make us worthy of the blessings thaa you have promised to the saints.
    We will gather with them and among them, and bear praise and thanksgiving to you, your father, and holy spirit, hosho...</p>

    <h3>Sedra</h3>
    <p>
        Lord Messiah, the Creator of all, and the One who sustains all things, the breath of salvation and life for the world,
        the everlasting and pure Muron, the unfading sweet incense, who filled our hearts with the beauty 
        of your divine wisdom, and made us weak and earthly beings worthy to stand in your holy presence, to worship and to minister the service of your divine and indescribable mysteries,
        into which angels long to look. Free us from the oppression of sin, and the lake of hollow thoughts.
        Make us worthy to perform good and complete service to you under your light and sweet yoke.
        Let us live our whole lives in your holy presence with good actions and wakeful souls and bodies,
        and to join the angelic life and the blessed end free from misfortune, distress, and sorrow, by your grace, and by the 
        graciousness of your blessed and hallowed Father who sent you for our salvation, and by the action of your Holy Spirit, hosho...

        who absolved our debts by your sacrifice for our sake, who died, and by gave us life by his death,
        who rose, and by his ressurection resurrected us, who ascended into heaven, and raised us with Him.

    <p>
        Lord God, we pray and beseech you. At this time of the completion of this divine service,
        may you bless you servants who gather in your holy house and await myriads of blessings.
        (Lord) Send us the good gift of your Holy Spirit. Purify our bodies and souls to make us worthy to receive
        your holy body and priceless blood. Dress us in your spiritual armor. Adorn us with love and unity.
        Save us from punishments and rods of wrath. Guard us by your victorious cross.
        Make us all worthy of the great place at your right hand at your second coming.
        We bear praise and thanksgiving to you, your father, and your Holy Spirit, hosho...
