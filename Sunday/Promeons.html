        <h1>Promeon and Sedra, to be recited after the main Promeon and Sedra of the Qurbana</h1>
        <h3>Promeon</h3>
        <p>Praiseworthy is the sweet fruit, and blessed is the beautiful offering who was offered up for us, who gave us the remission of sins, and who cleansed us by his purifying sacrifice. The lamb, the child of the virgin ewe, ascended the cross and rescued us, saved us from the sacrifices of dumb animals, and is worthy of praise and honor and glory, at this time of the divine sacrifice of worship, on all holy days, in all times and hours, and all the days of our lives.</p>
        <h3>Sedra</h3>
        <p>O Lord God, the omnipotent, who accepts this sacrifice of praise from those who are calling on you with all their hearts. Accept this incense from us, your sinful servants. Bring us closer to your holy altar. Give us strength to offer unto you spiritual sacrifices and offerings for our sins and for the crimes of your people. Let us act as acceptable sacrifices to you. Let the High Holy Spirit dwell on us, on this offered Qurbana, and on your faithful people, because of our Lord Jesus Messiah. The power and glory are his, yours, and your Holy Spiritâ€™s, now and forever.</p>
        <h3>Promeon</h3>
        <p>The Lord Messiah broke his body and fed us, poured out his blood and gave it for us to drink, gave us the inheritance of his heavenly kingdom, and is worthy of praise and honor and glory, at this time of the divine sacrifice of worship, on all holy days, in all times, and hours, and all the days of our lives.</p>
        <h3>Sedra</h3>
