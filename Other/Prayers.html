<p>
    O virgin who was chosen, and became the mother to God. And in her the curse was uprooted from the earth.
    Petition your only begotten that he may establish his peace and goodwill in his church and his people and in the four regions.
</p>
<p>
The Lord of the watchers descended and was concieved in ??? of flesh, and was clothed in pure body from her. The heavens are filled by him. And the earth
</p>
<p>
    Glory be to the one who moves the cherubim and seraphim. And descended and was concieved in the womb of the virgin.
    and was embraced by her in order to deliver Adam and his children from the dominion of death and Satan.
</p>
<p>
    The virgin Mary was mother for your divinity. And baptism is our mother. By the prayers of your mother and of your church, that you keep your truth and establish your peace in the four regions.
</p>
<p class = "subtitle">The saints</p>
<p>
    O holy prophets, and the apostles, sons of the kingdom, pray that there be peace in creation, that wars shall cease, and disputes be drawn out of us, and the church and her children shall sing praise.
</p>
<p>
    Your crowns on high, and your assemblies in the world܀
    Holy prophets, apostles, and martyrs. In the heights and depths, blessed is the one who magnifies your memories, seeds of peace in the church of the Messiah.
</p>
<p>
    The martyrs said to the son of God, "You, my Lord, we confess, and in your cross we take refuge".
    Call us, your people, to the feast that your Father prepared for that wedding, that the watchers might dwell in it.
</p>

<p>Glory be to the Messiah, in the memory of Mar Gevargheese, who cultivated the truth and perfectedd the assembly.</p>
