      <h1>The Matrimony Service</h1>
      <p class = subtitle>Introdution by the Priest</p>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>Priest:</p></div><div class="text"><p> Dearly beloved in Christ, Christian marriage is instituted by God and therefore it is holy
        and sacramental. You have come in the presence of God to be united in holy matrimony. The Lord
        has guided you until now and so you ought to remember His ways and praise His holy name. You
        should confess your sins with your whole heart and mind before the Lord. If you truly repent, He
        will forgive your sins. This service would be more blessed and meaningful, if you take part in it with
        that experience of forgiveness. Jesus Christ is the true bridegroom and the Church is the bride. He
        loved the Church and gave himself for her. We remember this ideal in the marriage service. Let us
        pray together for the grace of God, so that, through this married life, you may experience the love
        of God as revealed at the Cross even more and you may enter into a new fellowship with the Lord.
        May our Lord give you grace to lead an authentic Christian family life until the very last.
        </p></div></div>

    <p class = "subtitle">This is the complete version of the hymn used in the Malankara Orthodox Church. The Mar Thoma Malayalam hymn only has stanzas 6-9, while the English version (prose) contains stanzas 1-9.</p>
    <p>I, the Church, the holy Church<br> am the Bride of the Most High</p>
    <p>I worship the bridegroom who came<br>and betrothed himself to me<br>Blessed am I, says the Church...</p>
    <p>On the day I was bethrothed<br>Creation stood in wonder<br>I was poor and became rich<br>I am blessed and glorified</p>
    <p>He made me a chamber on high<br>to rejoice in with my friends<br>Blessed am I! I shall praise<br>My bride groom in the chamber</p>
    <p>He gathered me from idols<br>And he showed me mysteries<br>He told me that he would be<br>With me until the world's end</p>
    <p>The King's son has given me<br>A promise of much fortune<br>From his Father's Treasure-house<br>Therefore, I will worship Him</p>
    <p>Woe to the evil one who<br>decieved me by idolatry<br>Praise to the saviour Jesus<br>Blessed am I! and protected</p>
    <p>He clothed me by baptism<br>In spiritual armor<br>He gave his body and blood<br>As a ring on my finger</p>
    <p>The bridegroom is like unto the sun<br> And the bride is like unto the day<br>And the feast is like a tree<br>With tempting frangrances</p>
    <p>When I had first heard of Him<br>In me burned the fire of love<br>even before I met him<br>I confessed him. Blessed am I!</p>
    <p>I went round by land and sea<br>No one could tell me where he was<br>I searched for him in Bethlehem<br>They said, "He went to Egypt"</p>
    <p>With gladness I arrived there<br> the kingdom of Egypt<br>But they told me, "He has gone<br>To Nazareth in Galilee"</p>
    <p>I continued after him<br>and when I came to Nazareth<br>The people said "He has gone,<br>To the River Jordan"</p>
