      <h1>The Matrimony Service</h1>
      <p class = subtitle>Introdution</p>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>Priest:</p></div><div class="text"><p> Dearly beloved in Christ, Christian marriage is instituted by God and therefore it is holy
        and sacramental. You have come in the presence of God to be united in holy matrimony. The Lord
        has guided you until now and so you ought to remember His ways and praise His holy name. You
        should confess your sins with your whole heart and mind before the Lord. If you truly repent, He
        will forgive your sins. This service would be more blessed and meaningful, if you take part in it with
        that experience of forgiveness. Jesus Christ is the true bridegroom and the Church is the bride. He
        loved the Church and gave himself for her. We remember this ideal in the marriage service. Let us
        pray together for the grace of God, so that, through this married life, you may experience the love
        of God as revealed at the Cross even more and you may enter into a new fellowship with the Lord.
        May our Lord give you grace to lead an authentic Christian family life until the very last.
        </p></div></div>

      <h3>Psalm 51</h3>
      <p> Have mercy on me, O God, in Your loving kindness; in the abundance of your mercy blot out my sins.</p>
      <p> Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
      <p> For I acknowledge my fault, and my sin is before me always.</p>
      <p> Against you only have I sinned and done evil in your sight, that You may be justified in Your words, and vindicated in your judgement.</p>
      <p> For I was born in guilt and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>
      <p> But You take pleasure in truth and You have made known to me the secrets of your wisdom.</p>
      <p> Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
      <p> Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.</p>
      <p> Turn thy face from my sins, and put out all my misdeeds.</p>
      <p> Make me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
      <p> Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</p>
      <p> O give me the comfort of thy help again, and establish me with thy free Spirit.</p>
      <p> Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked, and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</p>
      <p> Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health; and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.</p>
      <p> Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord, and my mouth shall show thy praise.</p>
      <p> For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee; but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings.</p>
      <p> The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise.</p>
      <p> O be favourable and gracious unto Sion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
      <p> Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations; then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar.</p>

        heavenly blessings along with these rings. Clothe them with humility. Perfect their marriage with

        gentleness more fragrant than roses. May God save them from the wicked and envious who
        pervert the human race and from the evil-minded who corrupt the purity of wedded life. May the
        Lord bestow upon them times of well-being and years of blessedness.
        O Lord God, hear the prayers of us your weak and sinful servants who stand before your glorious
        presence, and grant to this couple happy days and the blessing of children. Enrich them with the
        wealth of virtuous deeds. Confirm them in true faith in you. Give them the grace to remain firm in
        that faith and to impart it to their children. Confer your goodness and benefits on all those who
        have come prepared for this marriage feast. Perfect the bridegroom and the bride with your
        victorious Cross. Shower your blessings upon us all, O God, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now

      <p>Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.</p>

      <p>Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan; and large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.

        And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one’s wife for any cause?” He answered, “Have you not read that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.”</p>
