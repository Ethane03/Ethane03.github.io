        Our brother(s) in Christ, our beloved in the true faith,
        our spiritual children, you who are of the right side of the body, you must understand this to be aware of the life giving mysteries of the Messiah,
        for you have desired to now draw near for the service of God, and for the station which is incomparable and unlike anything else. Our children,
        now, as you recieve this priceless and invaluable great gift through us, who are weak, guilty, and unworthy of such a high and glorious station, 
        we first order you thus: What merits are required for you to obtain this glorious station? You must guard from heresy that true faith, which our Lord Jesus the Messiah spoke to his pure disciples by the Holy Evangelion,
        and which they, the Holy Apostles, entrusted to the children of the Holy Church, which all the truly faithful fathers and teachers followed and were strengthed by,
        and which teaches and preaches of the One God in three persons, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, 
        so that you may walk without heresy or stain, in a manner worthy of the calling by which you have been called,
        and in a manner befitting those who recieve the sacraments of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.

        This must be your faith - outside, inside, on your tounge, and in your heart.
        You must confess loudly that the eternal Word of God the Father, One of the Three Persons, by his will, 
        and that of His Father, and of the Holy Spirit, descended from heaven and dwelt
        in the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and by His love of mankind put on flesh from her,
        and even while he dwelt in the virgin's womb he sat on the heavenly throne.
        He is fully God and fully Man. You must confess and believe this true faith, 
        and follow after Peter the head of the Apostles, St. Thomas, the founder of our Church,
        and their successors. You must listen to the authority (ചൊല്ലുവിളി) of us weak men. You must reject all heresies that depart from the true faith.

        Now, our children, we command you that you must be strong and diligent in the service of the Most High God,
        and that you must guard yourselves against diversions and disport, drinking, fornication, impurity, lustful desires,
        idolatry, sorcery, enmity, dispute, fanaticism, wrath, anger, quarrels, heresires, envy, murder, covetousness, ruin,
        and all other things resembling these. The blessed apostle Paul says "I tell you now, as I did before, that those who practice these things will not inherit the kingdom of God".
        These things distance men from the presence of God. The servant of God must be one who is unargumementative, unquarrelsome, stainless,
        sober in criticism, mature, orderly, hospitable to foreigners, not delighting in much wine, who does not extend his hand to strike,
        who is humble, who does not desire material things, who governs his house well, and who subdues and aquaints his children in all purity and obedience.
        For if he does not know how to govern his own house well, how can he govern the Church of God? He must must have a good testimony from those outside,
        so that he is not puffed up and does not fall into the nets of satan and the scorn of men.
        He should not open his mouth for curses or insults. He must not think to repay an enemy. 
        He must be removed from interest and extra profit, which consume the wealth of this world.
        For they are despicable before God the most High. Again our children, 
        you must be diligent in fasting, worship, and in prayer for yourselves and for your people before our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
         You must love foreigners and the poor, and behave toward the whole world in unity, in love, in peace, in forgiveness, in kindness, in grace,
         in faithfulness, in humility, and in tolerance. Those are the fruits of the Spirit. It is so that you may be worthy for service in the presence of God,
         that your souls may find comfort, and that your may stand before our Lord Jesus the Messiah with bright faces at His second coming to judge the living and the dead.
         We are free of all the iniquity which you incur. May we all bear praise forever to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>Cand:</p></div><div class="text"><p>Amen</p></div></div>
      <p class = 'subtitle'>The bishop continues,</p>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>
        Our children, draw the sign of the cross on this paper, 
        that it may be a witness that you will keep unadulterated  the faith that we entrust to you,
        and that you shall nor depart in any way from what we have commanded you,
        before God, before his angels, before this altar of the Lord, and before this assembled people.
      </p></div></div> 
      <p class = 'subtitle'>Here the person being ordained makes four dots in the shape of a cross</p>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>
        This is so that you might stand with bright faces before the judgement seat of our Lord Messiah, at his second coming.
         If you depart from our word, or reject our command, let God judge between us on the day of judgement.
        Behold, we now rise and pray, raising our hands to heaven, that the Holy Spirit might descend over you.
        For in this we are mediators (intercessors?). We have joined you to this high and majestic station.  
        So that God is in no way wrathful with you, you must be obedient to God, not being puffed up,
        nor competitive. Now we stand before God, his angels, and this assembled people. They are witnesses for you,
        that you might not depart in any way from what has been entrusted to you. If you now depart, you shall be alienated and stripped
        from what has been entrusted to you, and you shall be seperated from this lofty gift you have recieved.
        If you oppose us wretched and sinful men, or any of the metropolitans, our brothers, you will be seperated, distant, and rejected from the Holy Church,
        and will be stripped of the sacrament with which we have clothed you. 
        Thus shall be everyone who helps you in evil, rebellion, and schemes.
        Now God the most high declares to you: You must observe the canons of the Apostles and the true faith that we have entrusted to you.
        Understand that this cross is a witness for us and for you, that if you stand in opposition to us wretched men for even a day, 
        you shall be stripped of this gift that we have entrusted to you, for having transgressed our commands.
        We now pray and ask that our Lord Jesus the Messiah may save us and you from all unlawfulness and sin,
        and make you worthy to stand before him with joy and with the profit of the gold coins that we haave entrusted to you today.
