    God, Lord of every life, when you desired to redeem our race from the eternal wretchedness that results from sin,
    Your only son put on the garments of humanity, He died and was buried, on the third day He broke the bonds of death and rose to life, 
    and from our mortal and sinful bodies He has prepared a body in which we might experience eternal life in the resurrection.
    We remember all these things, and thereby give thanks to You. O Lord, this dear one has now come to the end of the days of his/her wretched life.
    But Your desire is always for our goodness. O Lord, we magnify Your Holy name for every mercy that you worked in him/her,
    and for taking him/her from this world filled with hardship and grief. May you make each of us worthy, by your Holy Spirit, to be prepared to come to your side at your call, 
    with peace of mind in the Messiah. Be gracious to us that we too might inherit eternal salvation with him/her and all your faithful.

      <h3>Psalm Selections</h3>
      <p>Listen to this, all peoples. All those in this world, take heed and listen</p>
      <p>Small and great, rich and poor together</p>
      <p>You see that the wise die, and the fool and unwise perish also, leaving their wealth to others.</p>
      <p>The man in honor, if he is unwise, is like the beasts that perish</p>
      <p>They are put in the grave like sheep, and death devours them. But the upright shall rule over them in the morning, and their beauty shall be undone in Hades from their dwelling place.</p>
      <p>He shall go to the generations of his fathers, he shall never see the light.</p>
      <p>Surely men walk about like phantoms; Surely they are disquieted in vain; Though they gather up wealth, they know not for whom they gather it.</p>
      <p>When you discipline a man with rebuke for his iniquity, you dissolve their wealth like a worm. Surely every man is vanity.</p>
      <p>Do you show your wonders to the dead? Do the deceased rise up and praise you? Is your mercy declared in the grave, your faithfulness in destruction? Are your miracles known in the darkness, your righteousness in the land of oblivion?</p>
      <p>Who is the man that lives and does not die, and who can save his spirit from Hades?</p>
      <p>You return man to destruction, and say "Return, O children of Men!"</p>
      <p>What is man, O Lord, that you remember him, or the son of man, that you consider him?</p>
      <p>Man is like a breath, their days are a fleeting shadow</p>
      <p>He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor treated us according to our iniquity.</p>
      <p>For He knows how He created us, and He remembers that we are dust.</p>
      <p>The days of men are like grass, they bloom as the flower of the field</p>
      <p>For the wind blows over it, and it withers. And its place does not know it.</p>
      <p>Yet the grace of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting over those who fear him, and his righteousness is for children's children</p>
      <p>The dead, and those who descend to silence do not praise the Lord. But from now on , we shall praise the Lord forever.</p>
      <p><em>And to you belongs the praise O God, Barek'mor</em></p>

      who undoes all things by His command, who brings forth life by His will and the end by his power,
      who is the breath of all things, return [തിരിയുക] over us, your weak and mortal servants.
      Aid us with you holy hosts until we depart from our short stay in the foreign land of this strange life, and reach heavenly Jerusalem.
      When the angels blow the horn, great armies cry out, and the hosts of Cherubim proclaim the power of your fearfulness 
      on the last day of your appearance, when your majesty dawns, your rule is proclaimed,
      Your Kingdom is revealed, your strength is made known, and your fearfulness rains down on all people,
      then fallen are the kingdoms! Undone are the lordships! Gone is the number of months! Ended are day and night!
      All creation is reduced to nothing. Then the heavens tremble. The sun darkens. The moon and stars put on dark clouds.
      Then you come in awfulness. You are seen in light. You set all borders and parts in trembling and shock.
      Then do the righteous rejoice. The saints are glad. All the children of light set out to greet your arrival.
      The wicked are ashamed. The unfaithful grieve. The throne of your honor is established. 
      Your terrible voice gathers all peoples. Justice strikes fear. The fire rages. The sword is sharpened.
      The darkness rises. Destruction and agony come swiftly. The gnashing of teeth is heard. The good are divided.
      The sinners are judged. The works of every person are examined publicly. O Lord God, merciful and abundant in blessings,
      we appeal to you: there in that hour make haste to save us from fear and torment. O Lord,
      have mercy on us because of your love for mankind. Look not on the hateful things we have done.
      Remember not the sins we have commited. Condemn us not to punishment in your terrible judgement.
      Leave us not in despair. Make us not heirs of fire. Bar us not from your grace. May you spread the wings of your mercy and cover us.
      Make us worthy of your kingdom. O Judge, who is Righteous, True, Impartial, who gives to each according to their deeds, 
      May we enter with you into the bridal chamber, with gladness and rejoicing, and sing praise for your grace and mercies.
      To you belongs the praise, along with your Father and your Holy Spirit. Hasha...

      O God, Eternal and Lord above tens of thousands, by your divine wisdom and grace you took 
      our first father Adam and formed him from the dirt, blew the breath of life and reason into Him,
      put him in authority over all, set him in the Paradise of Eden and allowed him to eat of every tree within it,
      and though you bade him to not eat of the tree of knowledge, he transgressed that command, eating from the forbidden tree,
      and because of this his disobediance he became an outsider to your righteousness and from the Paradise of joys he was
      cast down to the place of vexation, and he earned suffering and death for him and for us, his children.
      Yet, not desiring to completely abandon us, you have descended and put on our image, borne all the debt we had incurred,
      tasted the cup of death for our sake, descended to Sheol to loosen our bonds, you have risen from the grave 
      and raised us with you from the death of sin, you have raised us to heaven with you and sat us at the right side of your Father,
      and promised that when you come from there on the final day you will raise those sleeping in the earth, transform the living,
      and clothe them in an immortal and undecaying glorious body. O Lord, merciful and lover of mankind,
      have mercy on us, for we have taken refuge upon the hope and faith of your holy name. When you come
      to judge the living and the dead, and you arrive with tens of thousands of the angels and the sound of the trumpet,
      you raise those sleeping in the earth in  blink of an eye, and prepare the terrible judgement seat, before which no one is hidden.
      O God, the righteous judge and Lord of lords, who examines everone's works there and rewards each according to their works,
      in that fearsome hour, turn not your holy face from us. O Lord God, who is meciful and does not delight in the death of the sinner,
      Make us worthy, just as we hope that you will make this woman worthy, to hear the joyous voice saying, 
      "Enter, all you who are blessed by my Father, and inherit the kingdom prepared for you before the beginning of the world".
      There may we bear praise and worship to You, Your Father, and the Holy Spirit. Hasha...

      <p class = "subtitle">When lowering the body into the grave:</p>
      <p>Your glorious and powerful authority descended into the grave and worked wonders there. The angels were astounded.
        The bones of the righteous are gathered and put on glory. Body and soul are resurrection without ruin. Praise be to thee, O Lord.</p>
      <p>For Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, after he had begun to rot, woke by your voice. The daughter of Jairus woke at your arrival. At the last sound of your call, the dead will rise.</p>
      <p>Praise be to the power on high, who descended to the place of the dead, visited Adam, His own image, and raised the saints sleeping in the dust of the earth, and sent them out into the city in which He was crucified.</p>
      <p>The wise creator who binds all abodes under the yoke of death in His wisdom, plucks high kings from their places, and the judges from their authorities.</p>
      <p>We bear praise to you with glad faces, O Lord Messiah, who on the last day rasies all who take courage in your mercies and crucifixion, who consume your holy body and drink your living blood.</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">After placing the body in the grave the priest reads:</p>
      <p>Remember that Jesus defended the rebellious Zadokites from the divine decree that reproached them.</p>
      <p>Behold, He set out and overturned the slavery of men, he took hold of Satan's weapons, and ruined his army</p>
      <p>Behold, having subjected subjugation, He ascends and rules over all things. He is ready to come and make new by the power of His word.</p>
      <p>The good servants await the Lord of the House, to come back from the wedding and give them their wages</p>
      <p>The wise wait in hope with their lighted lamps, that when the Bridegroom comes from above, they shall enter in with Him</p>
      <p>The Lord says, "I am the resurrection and the Life". The one who believes in me shall live, even if he dies.</p>
      <p>I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord, from henceforth</p>
      <p>After my skin is thus lost, I shall see God unembodied. I shall see Him. My own eyes shall see Him and no other [with better eyes?]</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">Hymn</p>
      <p>Bitter is the day of death. It is a day of weeping and sorrow. O Lord, comfort us.</p>
      <p>Everyone must drink of the day of death. But it is more bitter and sorrowful if it comes in youth. O Lord, comfort us</p>
      <p>Death, which conquers all men, seized him swiftly. He was given no opportunity to know about his end. Comfort him by your resurrection.</p>
      <p>The brother does not save. The friend is no help. These words of the prophet have come to pass. O Lord, help us.</p>
      <p>It is right for each person to mourn their dead. It is right for each person to weep, for death has bereaved them.</p>
      <p>O Lord, praise be to You from all peoples, for by You the dead live, and the deceased rise and inherit the kindgom and sing praise.</p>
      <h3>Zumoro</h3>
      <p>Most bitter is the cup of death that Adam mixed for all his children! He has spread it from one to another for Adam and his children to drink.</p>

      <p>O God, merciful and Lord of all, who said "Behold, you are taken from dirt and to dirt you shall return, you are dust and to dust you shall return",
        we send this your servant into the earth, believing in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and taking refuge in our resurrection because of him,
