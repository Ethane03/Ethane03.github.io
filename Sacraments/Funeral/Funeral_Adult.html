      <h3>Verses from the Psalms</h3>
        <p>
        Hear this, all you peoples;<br>
        Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,<br>
<br>
        Both low and high,<br>
        Rich and poor together.<br>
<br>
        Surely everyone goes about like a shadow.<br>
        Surely for nothing they are in turmoil'<br>
        They heap up, and do not know who will gather.<br>
<br>
        You turn us back to dust,<br>
        And say, "...turn back you mortals"<br>
<br>
        He does not deal with us according to our sins,<br>
        Nor repay us according to our iniquities.<br>
<br>
        For He knows how we were made;<br>
        He remembers that we are dust.<br>
        As for mortals, their days are like grass;<br>
        They flourish like a flower on the field;<br>
        For the wind passes over it, and it is gone,<br>
        And its place knows it no more.<br>
        But the steadfast love of the Lord is<br>
        From everlasting to everlasting<br>
        For those who fear Him,<br>
        And His righteousness to children's children<br>
<br>
        The dead do not praise the Lord,<br>
        Nor does anything that goes down in to silence.<br>
        But we will bless the Lord<br>
        From this time on and forever more.<br>
        Praise the Lord<br>
      </p>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p>Glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p></div></div>

      <h3>Enyana</h3>
      <p>O Christ who promised new life<br>
         to the children of Adam<br>
         We honor your living death<br>
         and your great resurrection.
      </p>
      <p>
      O Christ, who commands the life<br>
      and death of Adam's children<br>
      Lead us not into judgement<br>
      On the day of your return
      </p>
      <p>
      O Christ, before whom all things<br>
      are uncovered and revealed<br>
      Reveal not our many sins<br>
      on the day of your glory
      </p>
      <p>
      O Christ, who judges all men<br>
      according to their actions<br>
      Wash away our sins and faults<br>
      and clothe us in robes of white
      </p>
      <p>
      O Christ, the key who opens<br>
      wide the doors of Paradise<br>
      Open your door of mercy<br>
      for us on the final day.
      </p>
      <p>
      Arise, O Children of Light!<br>
      Take up your lamps and set out<br>
      to greet the bridegroom on high<br>
      and enter in the chamber<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      The Voice that woke Lazarus<br>
      up from the place of the dead<br>
      Shall call and wake the faithful<br>
      from their graves at His return
      </p>
      <p>
      O Christ, King of creation,<br>
      who reveals ev'ry secret<br>
      May mercy stand before us<br>
      May your wings spread over us
      </p>
      <p>
      When the King on high appears<br>
      and with him all his armies<br>
      Those washed in the precious blood<br>
      of the Lamb shall be made glad
      </p>
      <p>
      Glory be to the Triune<br>
      Mystery of the Godhead<br>
      Father, Son, Holy Spirit<br>
      Let us bear praise forever
      </p>

              O Lord God, who created the world out ofnothing and brought
everything into being, You created man and woman and gave
them royal dignity. You gave them freedom and power to
choose good and reject evil. By the deceits of Satan, they violated
Your command and brought up on themselves the judgment of
returning to the dust out of which they were created.<br><br>
O God and Father of all mercies, You did not cast humankind
away as fallen, but You redeemed us by the death of Your only
Son whom You sent as the great physician for all humankind.
O Lord, lover of humankind, hear our prayers and petitions
which we now make at the funeral of our dear brother/sister who
has departed from this world of sorrow to the world of eternal
joy. O Lord God, at the Second Coming of Your only Son,
when He will reward the good and the bad according to their
deeds and give the kingdom to those workers who toiled with
discretion; when He will cast the wicked into eternal darkness
and receive the saints into dwellings of light; when both cry out
and say, "O Lord, You are just and Your judgments are most
righteous," we hope and believe that then this Your servant,
who has been baptized in Your name, who has taken part in
Your divine sacraments, and trusted in the crucifixion of Your
only Son, will not be abandoned in the deep pit, will not suffer
pain in the unquenchable fire, but will rejoice in the light of
Your countenance, will join the company of Your saints and
will inherit eternal bliss. In this hope, we have comfort at the
departure of this Your servant, and we comfort each other. We
also praise You for this glorious and blessed hope.<br><br>
O God of mercy and compassion, we pray that You would
console and comfort all of us, especially the members of the
bereaved family. Wipe away the tears from their eyes and
remove the great grief of their hearts. Fill them with the peace
that is above all anxiety. Deliver them from the anguish without
hope. Uphold their hearts with Your heavenly hope that they
may not fall into endless sorrow. Lead them with Your mighty
right hand into saintly perfection. Let them not despair like
people without hope, but have peace and comfort through faith
and trust in You. Satisfy them with all spiritual and material
blessings. Give them strength to praise You as did the righteous
Job saying, "The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord."<br><br>
O Lord, You know our end; help us all to be ready and prepared
to depart from this world when You bring us to our life's end.
Grant us an exalted position before Your throne. Remember us
all with Your intimate love for humankind. Make us worthy,
O Lord, to praise and glorify You with Your Son and the Holy
Spirit, with all Your saints, now and forever.

those who sleep in the dust. You have brought us into being
out of nothing by the holy will of the Father and the Holy

Your people offer with broken hearts and contrite spirits at the
funeral of this Your servant, who departed from this transitory

united once more he will be saved from darkness. He will shine
with Your light, he will rejoice in the joy of all Your saints, he
will abide in the blessed dwelling places and enjoy eternal life

rejoice and will rise up from the bondage of hell and dust, will
be delivered from the fiery furnace and will rejoice at the feast

us under the shadow of the wings of Your grace and draw us
closer to the dwelling places where there is no sorrow or pain.

      <p>Death is a teacher for all those who desire<br>
      To to leave behind sin and draw near to righteousness</p>
