          O Lord Messiah, our saviour and God, who said,
          "Let the little children come to me; do not hinder them", 
          and drew them to you and blessed them, we give thanks to you
          in the death of this child, who up to this day was raised
          in the loving lap of his/her parents, and at this time,
          which you have willed, has been taking into your bosom by death.
          O Lord, grant comfort and peace from you to 
          your servants who weep and lament over this.
          O Lord, for whom praise was prepared from the mouths
          of children and infants at your entry into Jerusalem,
          we have hope that at your second apperance in glory
          this child shall put on fine robes of white, 
          grasping palm leaves and with a golden crown encircling his/her head,
          and set out to greet you, therefore we praise and glorify you
          at this time of his/her funeral. Make us too worthy, 
          with this child and all the saints, to put ut on fine robes of white
          and an unfading crown, hold palm leaves and greet you.

      <h3>Verses of Psalms</h3>
      <p>O Lord, our God, how majestic is your name in all the earth, for You have set your glory above the heavens.</p>
      <p>On account of your foes, your glory is proclaimed from the mouth of children and infants, to destroy your enemies and foes.</p>
      <p>For I was born in iniquity; in sin did my mother concieve me</p>
      <p>For you, O Lord, are my protection. You have been my refuge since my youth</p>
      <p>From the womb I have reiled on you. You delivered me from my Mother's womb, my praises are about you always</p>
      <p>For though my Father and my Mother forsake me, the Lord is with me</p>
      <p>Remember not the sins and misdeeds of my youth; O God, remember me by your grace and according to the abundance of your mercies.</p>
      <p>To you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor</p>

      <p>This victory is without a battle, and wonderful. This name is miraculous and glorious.</p>
      <p>Praise be to the one who draws this child who has departed from this world, without drowing in the waves of the sea.</p>
      <p>Comfort comes to the dead, and grace and mercy to those asleep. For He is ready to come to them with Him sweet voice of ressurection</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">Another</p>
      <p>Our Saviour Jesus shall come in glory to raise the dead who believed in Him and comfessed Him</p>
      <p>Then He, the ruler of the whole world, shall sit on a chariot of fire, and enter into the court of judgement</p>
      <p>Then shall the books be opened and the righteous shall rejoice in eternal life</p>
      <p>In that house, O our Lord, do not refuse us from your divine sight</p>
      <p>Then with Hosannas shall we shout new praise to You, who raises the dead</p>

        and by your love for mankind became a child in order to bring us to perfection, because of your many mercies,
        you dimished your state on high into human infancy and by your grace you put on its image in order to bring it into your image.
        By the body that you put on in your descent, you became a child, you grew in each age,
        you recieved by your love the children who came near to you and spoke blessing to them by your holy mercies,
        Our Lord, we pray to you, beliving that you now recieve unto you this child whom you created, 
        that he/she is celebrated within the wings of your mercy like the children that you held in your holy hands,
        that he is counted with the children who sung Hosanna to you by their mouths,
        that he/she is  received unto the Spiritual altar that gladdens innocent childhood,
        that by your love you have set him/her in the bosom of the glory of your Holy Face,
        in the palaces and halls of you majesty, in the company of the lambs, the martyrs who were slain for your sake,
        and in the place where the righteous rejoice, that he/she is gladdened in the light of the wedding hall,
        that you have fixed him/her as a jewel on your bright crown, and a good seal in your shining hair,
        and that you have made him like a bright star in your resplendent heavens.
        Our Lord, comfort with your refuge those who mourn his/her seperation from them, 
        like a bunch of unripe grapes plucked from it's vine. Wipe away their tears.
        Put out the flames of their grief with the white dew of your mercy. 
        Quench their emotional thirst with the spiritual water of the drink of Life, which is your teaching.
        Let us all turn our mind by maturity and become as children.
        With him/her, make us too worthy of your heavenly kingdom.
        On the day of your glorious appearance, count us too with the lambs who rejoice at your right side.
