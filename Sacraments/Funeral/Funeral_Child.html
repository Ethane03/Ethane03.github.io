          O Lord Messiah, our saviour and God, who said,
          "Let the little children come to me; do not hinder them", 
          and drew them to you and blessed them, we give thanks to you
          in the death of this child, who up to this day was raised
          in the loving lap of his/her parents, and at this time,
          which you have willed, has been taking into your bosom by death.
          O Lord, grant comfort and peace from you to 
          your servants who weep and lament over this.
          O Lord, for whom praise was prepared from the mouths
          of children and infants at your entry into Jerusalem,
          we have hope that at your second apperance in glory
          this child shall put on fine robes of white, 
          grasping palm leaves and with a golden crown encircling his/her head,
          and set out to greet you, therefore we praise and glorify you
          at this time of his/her funeral. Make us too worthy,

      <h3>Verses of Psalms</h3>
      <p>O Lord, our God, how majestic is your name in all the earth, for You have set your glory above the heavens.</p>
      <p>On account of your foes, your glory is proclaimed from the mouth of children and infants, to destroy your enemies and foes.</p>
      <p>For I was born in iniquity; in sin did my mother concieve me</p>
      <p>For you, O Lord, are my protection. You have been my refuge since my youth</p>
      <p>From the womb I have reiled on you. You delivered me from my Mother's womb, my praises are about you always</p>
      <p>For though my Father and my Mother forsake me, the Lord is with me</p>
      <p>Remember not the sins and misdeeds of my youth; O God, remember me by your grace and according to the abundance of your mercies.</p>
      <p>To you belongs the praise, O God, Barekmor</p>

      <p>Praise be to the one who draws this child who has departed from this world, without drowing in the waves of the sea.</p>
      <p>Comfort comes to the dead, and grace and mercy to those asleep. For He is ready to come to them with Him sweet voice of resurrection</p>

        you dimished your state on high into human infancy and by your grace you put on its image in order to bring it into your image.

        that he/she is  received unto the Spiritual altar that gladdens innocent childhood,
        that by your love you have set him/her in the bosom of the glory of your Holy Face,

        that you have fixed him/her as a jewel on your bright crown, and a good seal in your shining hair,
        and that you have made him like a bright star in your resplendent heavens.
        Our Lord, comfort with your refuge those who mourn his/her seperation from them, 
        like a bunch of unripe grapes plucked from it's vine. Wipe away their tears.
        Put out the flames of their grief with the white dew of your mercy. 
        Quench their emotional thirst with the spiritual water of the drink of Life, which is your teaching.
        Let us all turn our mind by maturity and become as children.

      <p class = "subtitle">When lowering the body into the grave:</p>
      <p>Your glorious and powerful authority descended into the grave and worked wonders there. The angels were astounded.
        The bones of the righteous are gathered and put on glory. Body and soul are resurrection without ruin. Praise be to thee, O Lord.</p>
      <p>For Lazarus, the brother of Mary and Martha, after he had begun to rot, woke by your voice. The daughter of Jairus woke at your arrival. At the last sound of your call, the dead will rise.</p>
      <p>Praise be to the power on high, who descended to the place of the dead, visited Adam, His own image, and raised the saints sleeping in the dust of the earth, and sent them out into the city in which He was crucified.</p>
      <p>The wise creator who binds all abodes under the yoke of death in His wisdom, plucks high kings from their places, and the judges from their authorities.</p>
      <p>We bear praise to you with glad faces, O Lord Messiah, who on the last day rasies all who take courage in your mercies and crucifixion, who consume your holy body and drink your living blood.</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">After placing the body in the grave:</p>
      <p>We have heard the good news that those who die in Christ shall not taste death. It has been clearly preached to us that those who have fallen asleep in Christ shall never see the second death.</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">After covering the body with soil:</p>
      <p>O God, merciful and Lord of all, who said "Behold, you are taken from dirt and to dirt you shall return, you are dust and to dust you shall return",
        we send this your servant into the earth, believing in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, and taking refuge in our resurrection because of him,
        with the hope that you will raise him/her up on the last day. Our Lord, give life to our death by your death, and bless our burial by your burial.</p>
