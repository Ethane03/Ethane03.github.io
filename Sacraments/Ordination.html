      <p><em>Recite before the Praise of the Angels in Morning Prayer</em></p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p>I have sinned against thee, O God, Father Son and Holy Spirit. I have erred from thee by thought, word, and deed. O Lord, I knock at thy door and beseech thee for respite from evil; Send me your blessings from thy holy treasury of prosperity. O Lord, grant me repentance, grief, and tears of discernment to weep on account of the multitude of the crimes I have committed. O Lord, grant me thy grace that I may leave behind my sins that I have confessed. May thou blot out my trespasses. O Lord, as thou cleansed the sinful woman from her sins, may thou cleanse also thy servant from his sins. O Lord who stretched out thy holy hand and drew up Simeon from the sea, may thou also draw up me from the sea of my sins and crimes.  Align my steps with your enlightened way. Draw me close to the port of salvation, and delight me by your promise *according to my desire*. O Lord full of compassion and grace, bless me, and make me worthy to confess you, worship you and sing praise to you. Amen</p>
