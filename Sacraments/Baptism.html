      <h1>The Order of Worship for Holy Baptism & Chrismation</h1>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The child or the adult who receives Holy Baptism joins the Christian Church as its member. Identifying himself/herself with the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ who is the head of the church, he/she receives divine graces through Him. 
<br><br>
        There are some who doubt the efficacy of baptizing children. To think that Jesus who welcomed children and blessed them during His ministry will not receive them today is fallacious. We can surely hold that the faith of the parents or other members of the Christian faith can provide an occasion for bestowing divine blessings on children. It must be definitely emphasized that both the parents and the godparents of children receiving baptism have a great responsibility to bring the children up in devotion to God and in the Christian faith.</p>

      <p class = "subtitle"> In the tune of Mar Ephrem</p>
      <p>By your cross, protect, O Lord<br>
      those who came for baptism
      </p>
      <p>John spoke of this baptism<br>
        "I baptise you with water,<br>
        But the one who is to come<br>
        shall baptize with the Spirit"
      </p>
      <p>
        The pow'r hidden from angels<br>
        came to Zachariah's son<br>
        to recieve <em>mammodisa</em><br>
        At the banks of the Jordan<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lord came for baptism<br>
        And John came to bear witness<br>
        The Father himself declared,<br>
        "This is my beloved son"<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Ethra</h3>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p> O Lord, abundant in blessings, we pray for this Your servant who has come prepared for Holy Baptism. May he/she be sealed for eternal life, may he/she become an heir in Your household, may he/she be bound by Your holy commandments and offer praise and thanksgiving to You, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p></div></div>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>C:</p></div><div class="text"><p>Amen</p></div></div>
      <h3>Epistle</h3>
      <p class = "subtitle">Romans 5:20 - 6:8</p>
      <p>The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        <br>
        What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
        <br>
        For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
        <br>
        Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>
      <h3>Gospel</h3>
      <p class = "subtitle">St. Luke 3:15-16</p>
      <p>As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ, John answered them all, “I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">St. John 3:5-6</p>
      <p>Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
      <h3>Naming the Child</h3>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text italic"><p>The priest makes the sign of the cross with his thumb on the forehead of those to be baptized, saying:</p></div></div>

      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text italic"><p>Then the Godparent (the Godfather in the case of a boy, the Godmother in the case of a girl) holding the left hand of the child with his/her left hand, repeats (thrice) the words of renunciation after the priest</p></div></div>

      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p></p></div><div class="text"><p>Renouncing Satan<br>I fully believe in Christ</p></div></div>

      <h3>Prayer</h3>
      <div class="annot-text"><div class="annot"><p>P:</p></div><div class="text"><p> Lord, by sending Your Holy Spirit, out of nothing You have created this child as a living being, and by Your love You have made him/her worthy of Holy Baptism.  O Lord, build him/her upon the foundation of Your holy Apostles.  Plant him/her to grow and flourish in your Church.  Make him/her open to the mystery of the anointing of the Holy Spirit.  Perfect him/her with Your divine gifts.  May the hearts of these Your worshipers be kindled with Your light that they may be free from the bondage of sin.</p></div></div>
