      <h3>Hymn</h3>
      <p>David stands here in spirit by those who are to be baptized<br>
      Let us hear him say "All you who thirst come to the Lord<br>
      Be strengthened and be clothed in might<br>
      After Adam fell he cried out to God with a sigh<br>
      God answered Adam and came to the rushing waters of Jordan<br>
      And renewed his children who had fallen into corruption</p>
      <p>May the seal of grace be a protection for us who believe<br>
      Just as the Hebrews were saved by sprinkling blood on their doorposts<br>
      May the grace of this divine washing which gives new life<br>
      Save us who take refuge in this baptism<br>
      So that by the eternal light we may see the Trinity</p>

      <h3>Epistle</h3>
      <p class = "subtitle">Romans 5:20 - 6:8</p>
      <p>The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
        <br>
        What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
        <br>
        For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
        <br>
        Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</p>

      <h4>Pesgama</h4>
      <p>Hallelujah - Sprinkle me with your hyssop, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow - Hallelujah</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">St. Luke 3:15-16</p>
      <p>As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ, John answered them all, “I baptize you with water; but he who is mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</p>
      <p class = "subtitle">St. John 3:5-6</p>
      <p>Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
      <h3>Maniso</h3>
      <p>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity<br>
      The power of hyssop cannot cleanse me<br>
      Neither can the water of the law, a type of baptism<br>
      Only the sprinkling and crucible of the divine bath<br>
      And the riches of its great mercy can wash my sins!</p>

      Holy Church, open your wings,<br>
      and accept this spotless lamb<br>
      who is born of the Spirit<br>
      from waters of Baptism

        John foretold this Baptism:<br>
        "I baptize you with water<br>
        But He who comes after me<br>
        Will baptize you with Spirit"
      </p>

        The hosts of Heaven gather<br>
        around the baptismal bath<br>
        to welcome from the water<br>
        this newborn Child of God

      <p>O brothers and sisters - sing praise and thanksgiving<br>

      For he has crowned you all - with crowns, the envy of<br>
      Many kings and princes - and rulers of the earth</p>
      <p>Your clothes are whiter than snow, your faces are brighter than the Jordan. By the power of the Holy Spirit, you are borne up as angels from the River Jordan</p>
      <p>You have recieved the imperishable crown, Today you put on the glory of the House of Adam. Today your crown is worthy and your robes are splendid, which were first placed on you by the priest</p>
      <p>Adam bore a curse in Paradise, you have recieved glory by water. In the hour that the priest called upon the Holy Spirit, O beloved, you put on the armor of victory.</p>
      <p>Dearly beloved, in your fearless blessings, the angels rejoice and the spiritual are gladdend. You have recieved heavenly blessings, beware the evil one, that he might not steal you away.</p>
      <p>Sing praise to the king of heaven! He has made you lambs in His flock, and placed unfading crowns on your heads, now sing thanksgiving from your lips.</p>
      <p>The fruit that Adam despised in Paradise, is now joyfully placed on your lips. Depart in peace, O Children of Baptism, and worship the Crucified who protects you</p>
