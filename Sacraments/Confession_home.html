      <h1>Order of Confession</h1>
      <h2>To be completed at home</h2>
      <p><em>Recite before the Praise of the Angels in Morning Prayer</em></p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p>I have sinned against thee, O God, Father Son and Holy Spirit. I have erred from thee by thought, word, and deed. O Lord, I knock at thy door and beseech thee for respite from evil; Send me your blessings from thy holy treasury of prosperity. O Lord, grant me repentance, grief, and tears of discernment to weep on account of the multitude of the transgressions I have committed. O Lord, grant me thy grace that I may leave behind my sins that I have confessed. May thou blot out my trespasses. O Lord, as thou cleansed the sinful woman from her sins, may thou cleanse also thy servant from his sins. O Lord who stretched out thy holy hand and drew up Simeon from the sea, may thou also draw up me from the sea of my sins and transgressions.  Align my steps with your enlightened way. Draw me close to the port of salvation, and delight me by your promise *according to my desire*. O Lord full of compassion and grace, bless me, and make me worthy to confess you, worship you and sing praise to you. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 6</em></p>
      <h3>Tuesday</h3>
      <p>O Lord, abundant in pity, mercy, patience, and grace, I confess that I have done evil in your holy presence. Help me by your grace to truly repent of my sins. My sins are innumerable, they are more than the sand of the seashore. Because of the excess of my evils and wrongs I am unworthy to raise my eyes to you. O Lord God, I kneel in your presence with a humble heart, and beg for blessings on account of your grace. May you accept me, calling on you in weakness and in sin, and bless me. Make me worthy to bear praise and honor to you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit for every grace you have done for me, a sinner.</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 32</em></p>
      <h3>Wednesday</h3>
      <p>O Lord, who accepts the penitent, who forgives sinners their transgressions, I am bowed before you with repentance, grief, and regret, agonized in body and soul. Come to my side! May you accept me by your indescribable love for mankind, for you do not delight in the death of the sinner, but for him to turn from his evil way and live. As you accepted the contrition of the Ninevites, the tears of Mary Magdelene and of the publican Zaccheus, and the appeal of the thief on the cross, accept the contrition the request of this great sinner, and make we worthy to bear praise and glory to you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 28</em></p>
      <h3>Thursday</h3>
      <p>I have returned, O Lord, who desires all men to live and come to the knowledge of the truth, and I take refuge in your blessings, and seek the expiation of my sins from you. May you forgive my sins, which are unforgiveably many. I have seen and known my evils, and I knock at your door for grace. Forgive me and wipe away my offenses. Wash me from the impure stench. By your loving-kindness, have mercy on me and return to me your love and joy. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 51</em></p>
      <h3>Friday</h3>
      <p>O Lord, Knower of every secret, rest over me your right hand full of loving-kindness, and save me from my every sin. Grant me true repentance, and grace that I may live our my days in a manner according to your will. Send your blessing and divine grace to my weak prayer. Accept my prayer and tears for the sake of the sins and crims I have done. O Lord, may you not enter me into judgement and condemn me to punishment. Make me worthy to rejoice and praise you, your Father, and the Holy Spirit for your graces unto me. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 102</em></p>
      <h3>Saturday</h3>
      <p>I, a great sinner, sunken in sins and offenses, appeal to You, O merciful Lord. May you forgive me of all my offenses that I have commited, in public and in private, willingly and unwillingly, knowingly and unknowingly. I have returned as did the prodigal son. Accept me with grace! O Lord MEssiah, who accepts the penitent, who forgives the transgressions of sinners, who delights for those who have gone astray to return to his side, may you wash me and purify me from all the unholiness of sin, that I might bear unceasing praise, worship, and honor to you, to your Father, and to your Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 130</em></p>
      <h3>Sunday</h3>
      <p>O Lord Messiah, the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, I have have taken refuge and find provision in you. Grant healing for my diseases and perfect expiation for my sins. Make me worthy, O Lord, to keep your commandment, to be kept by you, and to partake of your body and blood. I rememeber my every sin. I confess them before you. I am greived over them and repent. Grant grace to my resolution to abstain from every sin. Declare for me your approval before your magnificent throne. Make me worthy of joy by grace and the wedding hall of happiness. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 143</em></p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, recite the Ten Commandments and the Nicene Creed</em></p>
