      <h1>Order of Confession</h1>
      <h2>The service to be completed at home</h2>
      <p><em>Recite before the Praise of the Angels in Morning Prayer</em></p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p>I have sinned against thee, O God, Father Son and Holy Spirit. I have erred from thee by thought, word, and deed. O Lord, I knock at thy door and beseech thee for respite from evil; Send me your blessings from thy holy treasury of prosperity. O Lord, grant me repentance, grief, and tears of discernment to weep on account of the multitude of the crimes I have committed. O Lord, grant me thy grace that I may leave behind my sins that I have confessed. May thou blot out my trespasses. O Lord, as thou cleansed the sinful woman from her sins, may thou cleanse also thy servant from his sins. O Lord who stretched out thy holy hand and drew up Simeon from the sea, may thou also draw up me from the sea of my sins and crimes.  Align my steps with your enlightened way. Draw me close to the port of salvation, and delight me by your promise *according to my desire*. O Lord full of compassion and grace, bless me, and make me worthy to confess you, worship you and sing praise to you. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 6</em></p>
      <h3>Tuesday</h3>
      <p>O Lord, abundant in pity, mercy, patience, and grace, I confess that I have done evil in your holy presence. Help me by your grace to truly repent of my sins. My sins are innumerable, they are more than the sand of the seashore. Because of the excess of my evils and wrongs I am unworthy to raise my eyes to you. O Lord God, I kneel in your presence with a humble heart, and beg for blessings on account of your grace. May you accept me, calling on you in weakness and in sin, and bless me. Make me worthy to bear praise and honor to you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit for every grace you have done for me, a sinner.</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 32</em></p>
      <h3>Wednesday</h3>
      <p>O Lord, who accepts the penitent, who forgives sinners their crimes, I am bowed before you with repentance, grief, and regret, agonized in body and soul. Come to my side! May you accept me by your indescribable love for mankind, for you do not delight in the death of the sinner, but for him to turn from his evil way and live. As you accepted the contrition of the Ninevites, the tears of Mary Magdelene and of the publican Zaccheus, and the appeal of the thief on the cross, accept the contrition the request of this great sinner, and make we worthy to bear praise and glory to you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 28</em></p>
      <h3>Thursday</h3>
      <p>I have returned, O Lord, who desires all men to live and come to the knowledge of the truth, and I take refuge in your blessings, and seek the expiation of my sins from you. May you forgive my sins, which are unforgiveably many. I have seen and known my evils, and I knock at your door for grace. Forgive me and wipe away my offenses. Wash me from the impure stench. By your loving-kindness, have mercy on me and return to me your love and joy. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 51</em></p>
      <h3>Friday</h3>
