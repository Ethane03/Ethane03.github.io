      <h1>Order of Confession</h1>
      <h2>To be completed at home</h2>
      <p><em>Recite before the Praise of the Angels in Morning Prayer</em></p>
      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p>I have sinned against thee, O God, Father Son and Holy Spirit. I have erred from thee by thought, word, and deed. O Lord, I knock at thy door and beseech thee for respite from evil; Send me your blessings from thy holy treasury of prosperity. O Lord, grant me repentance, grief, and tears of discernment to weep on account of the multitude of the transgressions I have committed. O Lord, grant me thy grace that I may leave behind my sins that I have confessed. May thou blot out my trespasses. O Lord, as thou cleansed the sinful woman from her sins, may thou cleanse also thy servant from his sins. O Lord who stretched out thy holy hand and drew up Simeon from the sea, may thou also draw up me from the sea of my sins and transgressions.  Align my steps with your enlightened way. Draw me close to the port of salvation, and delight me by your promise *according to my desire*. O Lord full of compassion and grace, bless me, and make me worthy to confess you, worship you and sing praise to you. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 6</em></p>
      <h3>Tuesday</h3>
      <p>O Lord, abundant in pity, mercy, patience, and grace, I confess that I have done evil in your holy presence. Help me by your grace to truly repent of my sins. My sins are innumerable, they are more than the sand of the seashore. Because of the excess of my evils and wrongs I am unworthy to raise my eyes to you. O Lord God, I kneel in your presence with a humble heart, and beg for blessings on account of your grace. May you accept me, calling on you in weakness and in sin, and bless me. Make me worthy to bear praise and honor to you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit for every grace you have done for me, a sinner.</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 32</em></p>
      <h3>Wednesday</h3>
      <p>O Lord, who accepts the penitent, who forgives sinners their transgressions, I am bowed before you with repentance, grief, and regret, agonized in body and soul. Come to my side! May you accept me by your indescribable love for mankind, for you do not delight in the death of the sinner, but for him to turn from his evil way and live. As you accepted the contrition of the Ninevites, the tears of Mary Magdelene and of the publican Zaccheus, and the appeal of the thief on the cross, accept the contrition the request of this great sinner, and make we worthy to bear praise and glory to you, your Father, and your Holy Spirit. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 28</em></p>
      <h3>Thursday</h3>
      <p>I have returned, O Lord, who desires all men to live and come to the knowledge of the truth, and I take refuge in your blessings, and seek the expiation of my sins from you. May you forgive my sins, which are unforgiveably many. I have seen and known my evils, and I knock at your door for grace. Forgive me and wipe away my offenses. Wash me from the impure stench. By your loving-kindness, have mercy on me and return to me your love and joy. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 51</em></p>
      <h3>Friday</h3>
      <p>O Lord, Knower of every secret, rest over me your right hand full of loving-kindness, and save me from my every sin. Grant me true repentance, and grace that I may live our my days in a manner according to your will. Send your blessing and divine grace to my weak prayer. Accept my prayer and tears for the sake of the sins and crims I have done. O Lord, may you not enter me into judgement and condemn me to punishment. Make me worthy to rejoice and praise you, your Father, and the Holy Spirit for your graces unto me. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 102</em></p>
      <h3>Saturday</h3>
      <p>I, a great sinner, sunken in sins and offenses, appeal to You, O merciful Lord. May you forgive me of all my offenses that I have commited, in public and in private, willingly and unwillingly, knowingly and unknowingly. I have returned as did the prodigal son. Accept me with grace! O Lord MEssiah, who accepts the penitent, who forgives the transgressions of sinners, who delights for those who have gone astray to return to his side, may you wash me and purify me from all the unholiness of sin, that I might bear unceasing praise, worship, and honor to you, to your Father, and to your Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 130</em></p>
      <h3>Sunday</h3>
      <p>O Lord Messiah, the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, I have have taken refuge and find provision in you. Grant healing for my diseases and perfect expiation for my sins. Make me worthy, O Lord, to keep your commandment, to be kept by you, and to partake of your body and blood. I rememeber my every sin. I confess them before you. I am greived over them and repent. Grant grace to my resolution to abstain from every sin. Declare for me your approval before your magnificent throne. Make me worthy of joy by grace and the wedding hall of happiness. Amen</p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, Psalm 143</em></p>
      <p><em>Afterwards, recite the Ten Commandments and the Nicene Creed</em></p>
      </p>
      <h2>The service in the church</h2>
      <p class = "subtitle">The exhortation given by the priest, while the congregation kneels before him to confess</p>
      <p>Dearly beloved in Christ, who have drawn near to commune in the Holy Qurbana of the body and blood of our 
        Saviour Jesus the Messiah, who was crucified for our sake, and whose blood poured out for the absolution of our iniquities,
        before you presume to eat of that bread and drink of that cup, you each must examine yourselves with care.
        It is nescessary for each person to examine themselves in order to eat this bread and drink from this cup.
        Remember the words of the Apostle Paul, that everyone who eats the bread or drinks the Lord's cup unworthily is guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.
        For if we recieve these with true penitence and purity of heart, we spiritually consume our Lords body and drink his blood.
        Then we abide in our saviour and our saviour abides in us. As often as we do this we make memory of our beloved saviour and His death until He comes.
        He has commanded us to remember His absolving cross and passion. By these we recive the abolsolution of our sins and become heirs of the kingdom of heaven.
        Therefore, I remind you that you must examine your lives by the rule of the words of God, 
        you must remember your every guilt and truly mourn, repent, and confess them unashamed, 
        and you must approach this Holy Qurbana with the promise to sin no more and with a pure concience.</p>
        <p class = "subtitle">Afterwards, the priest recites this prayer, and those kneeling recite after him:</p>
        <p>Before You, Omnipotent Lord Father, and before You, Lord Messiah who in order to save the world by Your grace was born of the holy virgin mary,
           suffered for our sake and died, and gave us salvation, and before You, Lord Holy Spirit, the Giver of Life, Comforter, and Sanctifier of all things,
          I confess and grieve every sin that I have commited. I believe the promise that you recieve the truly repentant,
          and your authority given to the priesthood that everything bound on earth will be bound in heaven, and everything loosed on earth will be loosed in heaven,
          and I confess to You that I have erred in all things. I erred through mind, word, and deed. O Lord,
          as you recieved that sinful woman, and the thief on the cross, recieve me also, and comfort me.
          May you make the holy body and holy blood in which I partake, not for my condemnation or guilt, but for life and salvation. Amen</p>
          <p class = "subtitle"> Afterwards the priest places his hand on the head of each of those kneeling, saying:</p>
          <p>May the omnipotent Lord God have mercy on you, forgive you of your every sin, and lead you into eternal life.</p>
