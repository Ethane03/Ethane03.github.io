      <p>Listen to this, all peoples. All those in this world, take heed and listen</p>
      <p>Small and great, rich and poor together</p>
      <p>You see that the wise die, and the fool and unwise perish also, leaving their wealth to others.</p>
      <p>The man in honor, if he is unwise, is like the beasts that perish</p>
      <p>They are put in the grave like sheep, and death devours them. But the upright shall rule overthem in the morning, and their beauty shall be undone in Hades from their dwelling place.</p>
      <p>He shall go to the generations of his fathers, he shall never see the light.</p>
      <p>Surely men walk about like phantoms; Surely he is disquieted in vain; Though he gathers up wealth, he knows not for whom he gathers it.</p>
      <p>When you discipline a man with rebuke for his iniquity, you dissolve their wealth like a worm. Surely every man is vanity.</p>
      <p>Do you show your wonders to the dead? Do the deceased rise up and praise you? Is your mercy declared in the grave, your faithfulness in destruction? Are your miracles known in the darkness, your righteousness in the land of oblivion?</p>
      <p>Who is the man that lives and does not die, and who can save his spirit from Hades?</p>
      <p>You return man to destruction, and say "Return, O children of Men!"</p>
      <p>What is man, O Lord, that you remember him, or the son of man, that you consider him?</p>
      <p>Man is like a breath, their days are a fleeting shadow</p>
      <p>He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor treated us according to our iniquity.</p>
      <p>For He knows how He created us, and He remembers that we are dust.</p>
      <p>The days of men are like grass, they bloom as the flower of the field</p>
      <p>For the wind blows over it, and it withers. And its place does not know it.</p>
      <p>Yet the grace of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting over those who fear him, and his righteousness is for children's children</p>
      <p>The dead, and those who descend to silence do not praise the Lord. But from now on , we shall praise the Lord forever.</p>
      <p><em>And to you belongs the praise O God, Barek'mor</em></p>
